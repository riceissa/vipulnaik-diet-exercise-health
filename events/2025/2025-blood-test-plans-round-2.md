## Tests around lipids, insulin resistance, and diabetic tendencies

### Enhanced lipid panel

Test details:

* Own Your Labs does not have this bundle, but the pieces other than Diabetes Risk Index total to $59.20
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/enhanced-lipid-panel-lipids-apob-glyca-dri ($50 as a package; it would be $61 if I ordered the tests individually)
* Request A Test doesn't seem to have GlycA and Diabetes Risk Index; the other two pieces cost $93 on LabCorp and $101 on Quest Diagnostics

This particular package is only available on Marek Diagnostics. It
includes lipid panel, Apo B, GlycA, and DRI. Of these, lipid panel and
Apo B are things I'd like to test regularly, while GlycA and DRI are
things I would like to get an occasional benchmark of. The individual
tests are $10 for the lipid panel and $17 each for the rest, totaling
to $61, so ordering the combo is better. Ordering the individual tests
on Own Your Labs or Request A Test is also more expensive.

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/comp-metabolic-panel-14/ ($10)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/collections/lab-builder/products/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp ($10)
* https://requestatest.com/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

I'd like to get a comprehensive metabolic panel, primarily for the
glucose reading that I can then view in conjunction with HbA1c and
insulin readings.

### Insulin

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/insulin/ ($14.40)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/insulin ($15)
* https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

This should be measured along with CMP to get a measure of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) by combining insulin and glucose.

### HbA1c

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/hemoglobin-a1c/ ($8.80)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/hba1c-hemoglobin-a1c ($9)
* https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $39)

This should be done in conjunction with a CMP so that the glucose and
HbA1c can be compared.

## Tests for hormone levels

### Total testosterone (LC/MS)

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/total-testosterone-lc-ms ($42)

Fill in the others

LC/MS is more accurate than the other methods.

It's not worth getting free testosterone (a more expensive assay) as
that's unlikely to be accurate anyway. By combining with SHBG and
albumin (see next subsection) we can estimate free testosterone.

### Sex hormone binding globulin

* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/sex-hormone-binding-globulin-shbg ($40)

Can be combined with total testosterone and albumin (part of CMP)
using an online calculator such as
[this](https://www.mdapp.co/free-and-bioavailable-testosterone-calculator-544/)
to estimate free testosterone.
