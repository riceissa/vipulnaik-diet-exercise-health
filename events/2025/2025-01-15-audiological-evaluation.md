# 2025-01-15: audiological evaluation

This document is for an audiological evaluation scheduled with
Berkeley Hearing Center for Wednesday 2025-01-15 at 3:45 PM.

The corresponding best practices doc is
[here](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-audiological-evaluation-appointments.md).

Background documents:

* [2024-11-29: reduced hearing in left
  ear](../2024/2024-11-29-reduced-hearing-in-left-ear.md) has
  background on the underlying issue motivating the audiological
  evaluation as well as my progress with investigating the issue.

* [2024-12-23: Berkeley Hearing Center
  call](../2024/2024-12-23-berkeley-hearing-center-call.md) has
  details on the phone call through which I booked the appointment,

## Call on 2025-01-13 and update to intake form answers

On Monday 2025-01-13 at 9:48 AM, I placed a call to Berkeley Hearing
Center to ask if I could update the intake form. They said that
there's no way to update it online, but that I could email
office@berkeleyhearing.com with my updated answers (to whatever
questions I wanted to update the answers for).

> What would you like to achieve from today's visit? Why did you decide to schedule an appointment today?

> I want to get a formal evaluation of the hearing in both my ears. I
> haven't had an audiological evaluation as an adult, and I have
> reason to suspect a loss of hearing, particularly in my left
> ear. More details on the loss of hearing are in later answers.

> In addition to the audiogram, I am also hoping to have my earwax
> situation formally checked as well as get some indications of
> whether there may be issues such as fluid buildup that are affecting
> my hearing. I have reasons to suspect fluid buildup, as elaborated
> in future answers.


> Please describe situations that you have hearing difficulty in:

> The magnitude of my hearing loss is small enough that it hasn't
> become an issue in normal situations. The main inconvenience right
> now is that my headphones don't feel balanced by default when I use
> them -- they feel slightly skewed to the right.

> I've attempted to quantify my hearing through a variety of methods,
> as documented below.

> a) Online single-frequency hearing test at
> https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test using both normal
> headphones and bone conduction

> b) Playing YouTube tracks such as
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo and identifying the
> minimum volume in each ear at which I can make out the words, using
> both normal headphones and bone conduction headphones

> c) Subjectively identifying what volume in the left ear seemed as
> loud to me as a given volume in the ight ear, using both normal
> headphones and bone cnduction headphones
