## Call on 2025-01-13 and update to intake form answers

On Monday 2025-01-13 at 9:48 AM, I placed a call to Berkeley Hearing
Center to ask if I could update the intake form. They said that
there's no way to update it online, but that I could email
office@berkeleyhearing.com with my updated answers (to whatever
questions I wanted to update the answers for).

> What would you like to achieve from today's visit? Why did you decide to schedule an appointment today?

I want to get a formal evaluation of the hearing in both my ears. I
haven't had an audiological evaluation as an adult, and I have
reason to suspect hearing loss, with asymmetry between the ears
(with more loss in the left ear). More details on the loss of
hearing are in later answers.

In addition to the audiogram, I am also hoping to have any earwax and
fluid buildup in my outer ear cleared, get a better understanding of
whether I have excessive earwax, as well as get some indications of
whether there may be issues such as fluid buildup in my middle or
inner ear that are affecting my hearing. I have reasons to suspect
fluid buildup, as elaborated in future answers.

If I do have excessive earwax that is adversely affecting my hearing,
I want to understand what at-home earwax removal regimen is likely to
work, or how to safely experiment to find out. So far I've tried one
round of sodium bicarbonate.

If the issue is fluid buildup in the inner or middle ear or something
else that cannot be addressed in your office or by me at home, I want
to get referrals for followup consults or diagnostic exams.

I would love to get more insight into any other things I should be
doing to prevent further hearing loss.

I also want a better understanding of how often I should be doing
at-home hearing tests (and any other advice you have regarding the
best ways to do such testing) and how often I should seek formal
audiological evaluation. As documented in later answers, I've been
doing some at-home testing to quantify my hearing loss and track it
over time, but it would be good to get thoughts on better ways to do
such testing.

> Please describe situations that you have hearing difficulty in:

The magnitude of my hearing loss is small enough that it hasn't
become an issue in normal situations. The main inconvenience right
now is that my headphones don't feel balanced by default when I use
them -- they feel slightly skewed to the right.

I've attempted to quantify my hearing through a variety of methods,
as documented below.

a) Online single-frequency hearing test at
   https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test using both normal
   headphones and bone conduction headphones, with the tests conducted
   every few days and at different times of the day and night; the
   results are fairly consistent across different iterations:

  * 500 Hz: Both ears are very similar to each other, on both normal
    headphones and bone conduction headphones (score of about 6 out of
    12 in both cases)

  * 1000 Hz: The right ear is a bit better than the left ear on normal
    headphones (8 left versus 5 right out of 12) but both ears are
    about the same with bone conduction headphones (8 out of 12).

  * 2000 Hz: The right ear is a lot better than the left ear on normal
    headphones (8 left versus 3.5 right out of 12) and also on bone
    conduction headphones (11.5 left versus 6.5 right out of 12).

  * 4000 Hz: The right ear is a lot better than the left ear on normal
    headphones (8 left versus 1.5 right out of 12) but only slightly
    better on bone conduction headphones (8 left versus 6 right out of
    12).

  Overall, the right ear is at least as good as the left ear for all
  frequencies, with a bigger gap on higher frequencies, and a bigger
  gap on normal headphones than bone conduction headphones. This seems
  suggestive that at least part of the issue is with the outer or
  middle ear.

b) Playing YouTube tracks such as
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo and identifying the
   minimum volume in each ear at which I can make out the words, using
   both normal headphones and bone conduction headphones. I use a
   Macbook Air I use the fine-grained control of volume by using
   alt+shift when adjusting the volume, allowing for 64 volume levels
   in total.

  * Using normal headphones, I can just about make out the
    words of the song with a volume of 6 to 8 out of 64 (left ear) and
    1 out of 64 (right ear).

  * Using bone conduction headphones, I can just about make out the
    words of the song with a volume of 1 out of 64 on both ears.

  These results paint a picture of comparison between the ears that is
  broadly similar to the picture painted by the single-frequency
  hearing test.

c) Subjectively identifying what volume in the left ear seemed as loud
   to me as a given volume in the right ear, using both normal
   headphones and bone conduction headphones.

  * Using normal headphones, a volume of 4/64 (1/16) on the right ear
    matches about 20/64 (5/16) on the left ear.

  * Using bone conduction headphones, a volume of 4/64 (1/16) on the
    right ear matches about 12/64 (3/16) on the left ear. However, one
    big difference is that with bone conduction headphones, the words
    always appeared muffled (though I could still make them out) to my
    left ear even at high volumes. I didn't have this issue with
    normal headphones, where I could hear the words very clearly when
    the volume was high enough.

I also attempted earwax removal on December 30, 2024. I used Earwax MD
from Eosera, which has sodium bicarbonate as its active
ingredient. Based on online information, I gathered that sodium
bicarbonate should not be used too often, even though it is effective
at earwax removal, because its alkaline nature is counter to the
acidic environment needed for the ears to be protected from
infections. Therefore, my plan was to use it once and see how
effective it was, but not use it further until a more formal
evaluation.

The use of Earwax MD seems to have only removed a small amount of
earwax, and comparing pre- and post- hearing tests using normal
headphones did not show any difference (I did not have bone conduction
headphones at the time, so I don't have pre- and post- data with bone
conduction headphones).

> 1. Have you ever experienced a sudden (<24 hours) or rapid (over
> several weeks/months) change in your hearing? Have you noticed that
> your hearing seems to change/fluctuate?

On November 29, 2024, when I woke up, I felt a sense of compression in
my left ear and thought I might have hearing loss there.  I initially
attributed this to earwax buildup due to sleeping too long on my left
side. Since then, the hearing in my left ear seems to be consistently
worse than my right ear. I only formally started testing on December
17, 2024 (and followed up with tests every few days) with normal
headphones and the hearing in each ear has been consistent since then
(no progressive deterioration). I added testing with bone conduction
headphones on January 2, 2025, and results for bone conduction
headphones have also stayed stable. Unfortunately, I did not do any
at-home hearing tests prior to November 29 so I can't say for sure if
my hearing objectively got worse on that day, but prior to that I did
not subjectively experience imbalance in my headphones.

> 3. Do you have ear pressure/ fullness/ the sensation of being underwater?

Additional Comments:

Yes, intermittently in the left ear, and almost never in the right
ear. I felt this most strongly on November 29, 2024, when I woke up
and felt I had lost hearing in my left ear.

Occasionally (a few times a week), I sometimes find that when I am
chewing food, clearing my throat, or burping, there is a reverberation
to my left ear but none to my right ear.

Occasionally (a few times a week) I also think I hear brief clicking
noises in my left ear every few seconds, but they go away quickly.

None of these symptoms triggers instinctive emotions in me, but it may
be that I'm paying more attention to them now and they used to happen
earlier as well. However, the asymmetry between the ears seems clear.

> 8. Have you ever had surgery on your ear(s)? (If YES, please
> explain)

Additional Comments:

I had surgery in early 1990 as a young child. This was in response to
a diagnosis of bilateral maxillary sinusitis based on an ENT X-ray and
examination by an ENT specialist, with supporting evidence from a
pathology report. The surgery included both myringotomy (to drain
excess fluid from my middle ear) and adenoidectomy (to remove my
adenoids, that were causing the problem). Prior to the surgery, my
audiogram showed a hearing loss of about 40-45 dB and a flat impedance
curve (not much variation across frequencies). Audiograms done after
my surgery indicated that my hearing had returned to normal.

I was able to get scans of records of the X-ray, pathology report, and
prescriptions for pre-surgery care, post-surgery care, and followup
care. I've assembled these into a PDF that I am attaching.
