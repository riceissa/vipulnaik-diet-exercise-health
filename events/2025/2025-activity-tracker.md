## 2025-01-07

On Tuesday 2025-01-07, in the evening, I made a multi-stop trip in
downtown Berkeley. I dropped off two used, worn-and-torn sweatshirts
at Goodwill. I then went to Citibank to get quarters for
laundry. Finally, I went to Trader Joe's for food purchases recorded

## 2025-01-15

On Wednesday 2025-01-15, in the evening, I went for my audiological
evaluation appointment with Berkeley Hearing Center; details
[here](2025-01-15-audiological-evaluation.md). On the way back, I
stopped at Berkeley Bowl for food purchases recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql).

## 2025-01-22

On Wednesday 2025-01-22, in the morning (and going a little past noon)
I went to the LabCorp location at 3100 San Pablo Ave for a blood
draw. See
[2025-01-22-blood-tests.md](2025-01-22-blood-tests.md#day-of-the-blood-draw-2025-01-22)
for more information.

## 2025-01-23

On Thursday 2025-01-23, I made a trip to downtown Berkeley. My first
stop was at Citibank, where I did a few financial transactions,
including withdrawing quarters for laundry. I then went to Trader
Joe's for food purchases recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql).

## 2025-01-26

In addition to my food purchases recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql), I also stopped at a few
ATMs: I stopped at the Allpoint ATM in the Walgreens on Adeline Street
before my Berkeley Bowl trip, and I stopped at the Chase and Wells
Fargo ATMs on Shattuck Avenue (near Center Street) on the way to
Trader Joe's.

## 2025-02-01

In the evening, I made a trip to Trader Joe's for grocery shopping;
the purchases are recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql). As it was raining lightly,
and I didn't want my purchased food to get too wet on the way back, I
decided to take BART back (from downtown Berkeley BART to Ashby BART)
instead of walking back (which is what makes the trip worthy of
recording in the activity tracker).

## 2025-02-21

On Friday 2025-02-21, in the evening, I made a long-overdue trip to
the Walgreens at Adeline Street to stock up on toiletries. I completed
checkout at 5:42 PM.
