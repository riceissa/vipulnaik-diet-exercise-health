On Tuesday 2025-01-07, in the evening, I made a multi-stop trip in
downtown Berkeley. I dropped off two used, worn-and-torn sweatshirts
at Goodwill. I then went to Citibank to get quarters for
laundry. Finally, I went to Trader Joe's for food purchases recorded
[here](../../sql/food_purchases_2025.sql).
