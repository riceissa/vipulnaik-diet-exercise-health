# 2025-01-22: blood tests

See [here](2025-blood-test-plans-round-1.md) for details on what I am
getting tested as well as the booking process. This document is
focused on the actual blood draw and the preparatory and recovery
steps.

## 2025-01-15: email received notifying me of the appointment location being closed

On 2025-01-15, in the evening, I received an email from LabCorp
notifying me that the 3000 Colby St location was closed until
mid-February. y plan is to go to the 3100 San Pablo Ave
location. Unfortunately, it's too late to book an appointment with the
location, so my plan is to try a walk-in, because an appointment for a
later date won't work with my schedule. If I am unable to get a blood
draw at the location on that date, I will likely book an appointment
some time later (likely mid-March or so) at the 3000 Colby St
location, which will likely be open by that time.
