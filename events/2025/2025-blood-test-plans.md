# 2025 blood test plans

## Tests

Total so far ecluding enhanced lipid panel that is only from Marek Diagnostics:

* Own Your Labs: $427.70
* Marek Diagnostics: $160
* Request A Test: LabCorp: $339 (also excludes creatine kinase); Quest Diagnostics: $226 (excludes both creatine kinase and cystatin C)

So far, Marek Diagnostics seems to be the cheapest and it also has the
enhanced lipid panel that the others don't have.

### Enhanced lipid panel

Test details: https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/enhanced-lipid-panel-lipids-apob-glyca-dri ($50)

This particular package is only available on Marek Diagnostics. It
includes lipid panel, Apo B, GlycA, and DRI. Of these, lipid panel and
Apo B are things I'd like to test regularly, while GlycA and DRI are
things I would like to get an occasional benchmark of. The individual
tests are $10 for the lipid panel and $17 each for the rest, totaling
to $61, so ordering the combo is better. Ordering the individual tests
on Own Your Labs or Request A Test is also more expensive.

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/comp-metabolic-panel-14/ ($10)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/collections/lab-builder/products/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp ($10)
* https://requestatest.com/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

I'd like to get a comprehensive metabolic panel, primarily for the
glucose reading that I can then view in conjunction with HbA1c and
insulin readings.

### Insulin

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/insulin/ ($14.40)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/insulin ($15)
* https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

This should be measured along with CMP to get a measure of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) by combining insulin and glucose.

### HbA1c

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/hemoglobin-a1c/ ($8.80)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/hba1c-hemoglobin-a1c ($9)
* https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $39)

This should be done in conjunction with a CMP so that the glucose and
HbA1c can be compared.

### Creatine kinase

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/creatine-kinase-total/ ($37.34)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/creatine-kinase-ck-total ($6)
* Request A Test doesn't seem to have this, but it has a creatine test for $39; I do not know for sure how the tests relate

This is good as a measure of muscle growth/damage/regrowth and can be
good for the interpretation of ALT and AST values that are part of a
CMP.

### C-reactive protein (high-sensitivity)

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/c-reactive-protein-cardiac/ ($26.40)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-hs-crp ($23)
* https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

### Complete blood count (CBC) with differential

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/cbc-with-differential-platelet/ ($8.40)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/complete-blood-count-cbc-with-nlr-differential-and-platelets ($10)
* https://requestatest.com/cbc-with-differential-testing (LabCorp: $29; Quest Diagnostics: $35)

### Cystatin C (for more accurate kidney eGFR)

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/cystatin-c-2/ ($322.36)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/cystatin-c-with-egfr ($87)
* https://requestatest.com/cystatin-c-test (LabCorp: $119; not available on Quest Diagnostics)

This is expected to be a once every 4-8 years test for a more accurate
estimate of eGFR. If it agrees with the estimate I obtain via
creatinine as part of the CMP, then I don't need to redo this test for
at least 4 years. In case of significant divergence though (with the
cystatin C value *much lower*), I may need to do this test annually.
