# 2025 blood test plans

## Current planned test time

I'm thinking of getting these tests done around late March or early
April 2025.

## Cost estimate

Cost estimates were based on list prices on ownyourlabs.com,
marekdiagnostics.com, and requestatest.com on 2024-10-14.

Total cost of tests so far:

* Own Your Labs: $209.15
* Marek Diagnostics: $168 or $181 depending on variant, plus $5 phlebotomist fee
* Request A Test: LabCorp: $380; Quest Diagnostics: $317 not including NMR lipoprofile which is exclusive to LabCorp

So far, it looks like Marek Diagnostics is the winner.

## Test reruns from 2024

For background, see [2024 blood test plans: Results and
takeaways](../2024/2024-blood-test-plans.md#results-and-takeaways).

### NMR lipoprofile with insulin resistance markers: an advanced version of the lipid panel (for a one-time advanced measurement; in the future I expect to return to a regular lipid panel and do the NMR every few years)

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/nmr-lipoprofile-lipids-ir-markers-graph/ ($78.61)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/nmr-lipoprofile%C2%AE-with-lipids-and-insulin-resistance-markers-with-graph?_pos=2&_sid=b3579a4ac&_ss=r ($75)
* https://requestatest.com/nmr-lipoprofile-with-insulin-resistance-markers-test (LabCorp: $119; this test is not available on Quest Diagnostics)

After my September 2024 test, I reduced my olive oil consumption,
added seaweed, and increased my omega-3 dosage. The first of these is
expected to have a direct effect through reducing my saturated fat
levels. Increasing omega-3 dosage may also help.

I'm getting the NMR version as that also includes particle count. I
can also use this particle count to see if the measured apolipoprotein
B is as expected (apolipoprotein in mg/dL should be a little more than
0.054 times the LDL-P measured in nmol/L, because there should be one
apo B per LDL-P, and apo B molecular weight is 540000, so 1 nmol/L is
540000 ng/L = 0.54 mg/L = 0.054 mg/dL. There will be some additional
apo B coming from VLDL and IDL so the apo B should generally be a
little higher than estimated this way).

If this measurement continues to show values in the same range as
September 2024, I plan to devote significant further resources to
learning and trying things to reduce cholesterol.

### Apolipoprotein B

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/apolipoprotein-b/ ($17.20)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/apolipoprotein-b-apob?_pos=1&_sid=17bbc195f&_ss=r ($17)
* https://requestatest.com/apolipoprotein-b-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $65)

Based on recent reading, apolipoprotein B is the mechanism by which
high cholesterol levels increase the risk of atherosclerosis. The
level of apolipoprotein B may therefore be a more direct metric of the
rate of damage. It will be good to measure this. I think it's
important to measure this along with lipid profile, in order to get a
clear correlational picture of the two. In particular, it is expected
that apo B (in mg/dL) is about 0.054 times LDL-P (in nmol/L).

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/comp-metabolic-panel-14/ ($10)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/collections/lab-builder/products/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp ($10)
* https://requestatest.com/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

This is a good test to get done regularly. However, the particular
motivation for doing it just 6-7 months after the previous test is to
confirm that the low BUN level (which was due to temporary diet
changes that reduced protein intake) has been fixed.

I might end up combining this with a CBC with differential; however,
as of the time of writing this, I don't see a compelling reason to get
a CBC with differential just 6-7 months after the previous
one. However, if I have concerning health episodes in the interim, it
may make sense to get one.

### Omega-3: followup measurement to test the success of supplementation and dietary changes

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/omega-check/ ($66)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/omega-check?_pos=1&_sid=072c542f9&_ss=r ($60)
* https://requestatest.com/omega-3-blood-test (LabCorp: $129; Quest Diagnostics: $129)

The goal is to see if the [supplement dosage increase started
2024-09-25](../2024/2024/2024-09-25-decision-to-increase-omega-3-supplement-daily-dose.md) is working well.

## New tests

### Creatine

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/creatine-kinase-total/ ($37.34)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/creatine-kinase-ck-total?_pos=1&_sid=4b311cf52&_ss=r ($6), https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/creatine-kinase-ck-total-isoenzymes?_pos=2&_sid=4b311cf52&_ss=r ($19)
* https://requestatest.com/creatine-blood-test (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $89)

I haven't been tested before for this (according to my records), but I
did get a test for the related creatinine, where I was below the
expected range. However, the creatinine test was mainly to detect
being *above* the relevant range.

Creatine is something that vegans are expected to be deficient in. In
2021, I skipped the testing as I was not planning to start on
supplementation even conditional to being deficient. In 2024, I
skipped the test from the first set of tests as I was already getting
a lot of things tested. Now that I've been doing strength exercises
more regularly, I think I'm prepared to start supplementation if
deficient, and the test results might inform the dose I use to
supplement.
