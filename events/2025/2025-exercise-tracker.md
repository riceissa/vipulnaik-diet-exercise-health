## 2025-01-01: at-home jogging

I did at-home jogging on 2025-01-01. The rest of my exercise proceeded
normally.

## 2025-01-02: skipped exercise due to call with work colleagues

I skipped all exercise due to a call with work colleagues that used up
the time I would normally exercise.

## 2025-01-03 and 2025-01-04: at-home jogging

I did at-home jogging on 2025-01-03 and 2025-01-04. The rest of my
exercise proceeded normally. On both days, this was due to it being
quite cold and my desire to finish jogging soon rather than wait till
later in the day when it would be slightly warmer.

On 2025-01-05, I returned to jogging outside.

## 2025-01-06: abridged at-home jogging and skipped dead hang / pull-ups

On Monday 2025-01-06, I did abridged at-home jogging primarily due to
time constraints (about half the usual length). I also skipped dead
hang and pull-ups, also due to time constraints.

## 2025-01-09: skipping all exercise due to general fatigue plus timing constraints

On 2025-01-09, I skipped exercise due to a mix of general fatigue and
timing constraints. I had stayed up late the previous day, got to bed
late, woke up late, and had a somewhat busy morning. I didn't want to
delay eating too much and I wanted to reset to an earlier time, and
going out to exercise would have delayed things quite a bit.

I was also generally fatigued from the past few hectic days, and also
slightly underslept, and felt that skipping exercise would help me
recover more quickly.

I also have a lot of work to do, and skipping exercise could save me
valuable time and help me get more on top of things.

## 2025-01-12: skipping all exercise due to time crunch for the day (due to sleep time adjustment needed)

Primarily due to a large cyclic personal chores load, I went to sleep
late on 2025-01-11 (around 3 AM), and correspondingly got up late on
the morning of 2025-01-12 (around 11 AM). This would not normally be a
problem, but I need to be up by 9 AM on 2025-01-13 to be ready for
work meetings, which means I effectively have 2 hours less for
2025-01-12. Skipping exercise is the prudent course to achieve this
(because exercise not only directly costs time but also imposes an
additional 1-hour delay on the meal start time).

This might also be generally helpful considering that I am generally
time-squeezed these days.

## 2025-01-13: at-home jogging, hand gripper close failure, and abridged strength exercises

I did at-home jogging on 2025-01-13 due to having a bunch of work
meetings (including some with active participation needed and some
where I was more passive).

I had a bit of soreness in the back of the neck / shoulders yesterday
(with mor on the left shoulder), and although the feeling of soreness
was mostly gone, my strength in those areas was not yet back to
normal. As a result, I was unable to fully close the 150 lb hand
gripper with my left hand. However, when I tried later in the day, I
was able to close it, suggesting that my strength had recovered at
least to some extent.

For strength exercises, I was initially thinking of skipping, then
decided to give them a try to get a benchmark of how much I can do in
this state. I did both the usual exercises for 3 lb and 5 lb with no
difficulty but with greater experienced fatigue than usual. For 8 lb,
I did exercise 1 and then stopped. I did not do exercise 2 on 8 lb or
exercise 1 on 10 lb, partly because I was already exhausted and partly
because I didn't want to risk doing these harder exercises.

For push-ups, I stopped at around 7 or 8 instead of going to the usual
13 or higher. This reflected soreness and fatigue.

## 2025-01-16: at-home jogging due to scheduling issues

On 2025-01-16, despite good weather, I did at-home jogging due to
scheduling issues (I didn't have enough time to go out to jog before a
work meeting).

## 2025-01-17 to 2025-01-19: at-home jogging due to cold weather plus overall time constraints

From 2025-01-17 to 2025-01-19, I did at-home jogging, due to a mix of
cold weather and overall time constraints (no imminent scheduling
issues).

## 2025-01-21: skipping of all exercises except balance exercises

On Tuesday 2025-01-21, in preparation for the next day's blood draw, I
skipped all exercises except balance exercises
(standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed).

## 2025-01-22: skipping of all exercises for blood draw

On Wednesday 2025-01-22, I skipped all exercises for my blood draw,
conserving both time and energy for the blood draw.

## 2025-01-23: resumption of some exercises

On Thursday 2025-01-23, I resumed jogging (going out for it) and also
did humming-with-intermittent-pauses. I skipped hand gripper
exercises. I also didn't do standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises, but that's just because
they weren't due today as I had done them on Tuesday.

I carried back fairly heavy groceries in the evening on 2025-01-23, so
even though I didn't resume any strength exercises, this did *de
facto* play a similar role.

## 2025-01-24: resumption of hand gripper exercises (left hand only) and skipping of jogging

On Friday 2025-01-24, I skipped jogging in the morning due to time
constraints. In fact I didn't do any exercises at all in the morning.

Instead, I did hand gripper exercises with my left hand only (skipping
my right hand due to the recent blood draw from it) as well as
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed and
standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed exercises, both later in the
evening, a little under three hours after finishing my first meal.

## 2025-01-25: resumption of hand gripper exercises (right hand)

On Saturday 2025-01-25, I resumed hand gripper exercises with my right
hand. I had resumed the left hand the previous day, so this completed
the resumption of hand gripper exercises.

## 2025-01-26: resumption of strength exercises

On Sunday 2025-01-26, I resumed strength exercises (dead hang and
pull-ups). This begins a new 3-day cycle, with the next day for dumb
bells and push-ups and the third day for rest from strength exercises.

## 2025-01-27: at-home jogging and skipping of strength exercises due to time constraints and scheduling issues

On Monday 2025-01-27, I did at-home jogging and skipped strength
exercises due to a combination of time constraints and scheduling
issues.

## 2025-01-29 and 2025-01-30: at-home jogging due to cold weather, time constraints, and to allow better multiplexing

On Wednesday 2025-01-29 and Thursday 2025-01-30, I did at-home jogging
due to a mix of considerations: cold weather, time constraints, and
better multiplexing. On Wednesday, I wanted to turn the stove on at
around midway through my jog, and I need to be at home when the stove
is on. On Thursday, I multiplexed part of my jogging with a
listen-only work meeting.

## 2025-01-31: at-home jogging due to cold weather and rain, skipping of strength exercises due to scheduling constraints

On Friday 2025-01-31, I did at-home jogging due to the cold weather
and rain. I also skipped strength exercises due to scheduling
constraints (I needed to finish my second meal by a certain time, and
working backwards that worked out to a tight timeline).

## 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-02: at-home jogging due to rain and wet sidewalks

On 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-02, I did at-home jogging due to rain and
wet sidewalks. The temperature was actually fine (it was not too
cold).

## 2025-02-03: at-home jogging due to intermittent rain

On 2025-02-03, the sidewalks had mostly dried from previous rain, and
it was warm, and I was planning to go out to jog. However, as I was
getting ready to go out, I saw a weather forecast of a brief burst of
rain for the next 30 minutes. In light of this, I cancelled my plan to
go out and did at-home jogging.
