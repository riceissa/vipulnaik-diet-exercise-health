# 2021-11-02 weight-lifting and stretching

On Tuesday, November 2, 2021, I received my order of weights. The
previous day I had received my exercise mat order.

Starting on Tuesday, I began alternating-day weightlifting, pushups
and stretching exercises.

I had already been doing stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises
reasonably regularly; I resolved to do these as part of my
alternate-day practice, though I might also do it on the other days
when I wasn't doing weightlifting.

All my weightlifting and stretching exercises are done while on the
exercise mat; the stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed I may do while on
and off the exercise mat (stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed is harder
on a mat because of the less stable surface of the mat).

I'm starting with 2 lb weights and will progress to 3 lb after a few
weeks.

## Subsequent updates

* In December 2021, I switched from just doing 2 lb to doing both 2 lb
  and 3 lb.

* In March 2022, I switched from doing 2 lb and 3 lb to doing 3 lb and
  5 lb.
