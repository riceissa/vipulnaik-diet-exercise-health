# 2023-01-21: gum pain and bleed

While flossing on the evening of 2023-01-21 (with a floss pick using a
long floss holder), I noticed that for one particular pair of teeth,
flossing it caused some pain. Bsaed on the advice from the dentist at
the last consultation, I decided to floss repeatedly to remove any
food debris that might be causing a local inflammation. Prior to this
I had not noticed any pain in that pair of teeth.

After flossing vigorously a couple of times, I did extract a small
piece of food. But a side-effect was that when I spat out I noticed
some blood, suggesting that the repeat flossing of the sensitive area
led to a bit of bleeding.
