# 2023-12: injured and swollen lower left lip

Sometime early in the month, I bit my lower left lip. There was no
visible bleeding or swelling in the area. For the most part, it did
not pain except when probed or when I was swirling in the area when
rinsing. On 2023-12-09, I accidentally poked or bit around the area a
little bit more. This injury smarted when I was doing a saltwater
rinse but was otherwise okay. While I could identify the area by
probing, I could not see anything visually different in the mirror
even when doing a careful examination.

There was a significant improvement in terms of reduced extent of
smarting on Saturday 2023-12-16 in the morning rinse. By the evening
rinse, the smarting was so little that I didn't even notice it enough
to care. By Monday 2023-12-18, everything seemed normal.

When I woke up on the morning of 2023-12-20, I noticed a swelling in
my lower left lip, around the same area as the past injury, but with
the swelling now bigger and more visible when I looked carefully in
the mirror, and also the swelling covering a small area. However,
unlike last time, it didn't hurt at all on probing; it just felt a bit
awkward. I do not know for sure whether this is a continuation of the
healing process of the previous injury, or something new, or something
in-between (the old area being rawer was susceptible to new
issues). The current appearance seems to more closely match the
definition and imagery for "canker sore" that I can gather online.
