# 2023-12-22: strained rib

## 2023-12-22

Early in the morning, before waking up, I noticed that an area of my
right rib was hurting and strained, likely as a result of bad posture
or movement while I was sleeping. In the early hours of the morning, I
slept mostly on my left side as it was painful to sleep on my right
side.

The pain was much less after I woke up and moved to a sitting
position, and I forgot about it for most of the day. However, I did
occasionally feel some pain when making sudden movements and when
carrying laundry up the steps.

Later, when jogging, I noticed a bit more fatigue than usual due to
occasional movement that strained the rib further. So, I jogged a
little less than I normally would (about 1 mile instead of 1.25 miles)
but my total jogging + walking distance was the usual 2 miles. I also
skipped the strength exercises that I would normally do after
returning from jogging, out of concern that the strength exercises
would add to the strain.

My overnight sleep was reasonably good and although I did experience
the pain a few times intermittently, it was nowhere near as bad as on
2023-12-22. One trick I used initially for sleeping on my right side
was to have my right arm directly underneath the rib so that it bore
the weight and reduced the stress on the rib.

After waking up on 2023-12-23, I was abe to carry out my day as usual
without being obviously hindered by the rib strain; I noticed the rib
strain only a couple of times intermittently.
