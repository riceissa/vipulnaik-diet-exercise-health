# 2023-11-01: weight-lifting weight increase

On Wednesday, November 1, 2023, I bought an 8 lb dumb bell (single
piece) from Walgreens as part of a trip to the store. My goal is to do
simpler exercises with the 8 lb dumb bell while continuing to do the
harder exercises with 3 lb and 5 lb dumb bells.
