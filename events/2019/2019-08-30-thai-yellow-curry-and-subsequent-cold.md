On Thursday, August 29, 2019, the Chaat Cafe, an Indian restaurant
that I've been getting food from about thrice a week, shut down.

To reinstate some dietary diversity, on August 30, 2019, I got a
yellow curry from Bangkok Thai Cuisine. This is a typical Thai yellow
curry, with carrots, potatoes, and onions.

Starting Saturday, August 31, I had a runny nose and thoat irritation
for 2-3 days. I believe this is because the yellow curry was quite
heavy. However, I can't rule out the possibility of an infection.

The runny nose peaked on the weekend and was mostly recovered by
Monday. Tuesday it was almost completely recovered. Wednesday was a
normal day.

I believe it was an irritation caused by the yellow curry and not
an infection, because normally infections need more recovery time.

I tried the Thai yellow curry again on Friday September 6. This time,
I made a few changes:

* I didn't have the whole yellow curry -- only about half of it.

* I mixed it with my cooked meal (tomatoes, eggplants, bell peppers)
  to reduce the relative overdose of the spices in the yellow curry
  and also with almond milk.

I felt a somewhat similar irritation, but lesser in magnitude, so I
believe this dosage works well. There was no runny nose the next day
(Saturday, September 7).

I'll have the remaining half of the yellow curry after a few days.
