In light of the [dentist recommendation made on the 2019-01-08 dentist
visit](2019-01-08-dentist-visit.md), I'm looking at pros and cons of
various options.

## Dental cleaning and wisdom tooth removal

### Reasons for delaying

* I would like to fully recover and rejuvenate from my current
  symptoms of fatigue and pains, because going through another dental
  procedure that might be stressful. I expect to take a few weeks to
  recover and then a few months to equilibrate at the new level.

* With sufficient delay, I may be able to get the relevant procedures
  done more cheaply by better price comparison, and maybe even get it
  done in India. If the latter, I might have more time to recover
  after the procedure without affecting my work life.

* I want to get more familiar with the pros and cons of wisdom tooth
  removal.

* I would also like to start taking better care of my inner teeth and
  see how much I can bring the dental problems under immediate
  control. It seems like it's mostly plaque right now and not calculus
  (tartar) so should be removable through regular dental care. The
  calculus would need to be removed through a cleaning but I can at
  least prevent new calculus from forming.

### Reasons for getting it done sooner

* The calculus on the teeth is irreversible without a cleaning; if I
  get a cleaning then I can start fresh.

* The gum evaluation might surface the need for a deeper cleaning.

## Dental changes

My frequency of brushing is quite good, but I need to incorporate some
more diverse methods to deal with a bunch of things that brushing
alone doesn't.

* Brush more on the inside teeth. I also need to develop a better
  sense of the cleanliness of the inside teeth, both through careful
  examination in the mirror and through the use of my tongue to probe
  the inside teeth.

* Consider
  [flossing](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/features/to-floss-or-not-to-floss). It
  looks like flossing isn't that necessary for the visible aspects of
  dental cleanliness, and isn't much help in reducing cavities if
  you're already brushing regularly. However, the current wisdom is
  that flossing does seem to have an effect on gum disease, because it
  gets between the teeth in a way a toothbrush can't. NOTE: It looks
  like interdental brushes are generally preferred to flossing, and
  seem more reliable. I'll get one and see if I can use it daily.

* Look into oil pulling. I'm not really able to make out if this is
  legit, but it might be worth looking into.

* Use salt-water gargling.

* Brush and rinse well after having drinks like hot
  chocolate. Although these don't leave particles in the mouth, they
  can make the mouth sweeter and corrupt its ecosystem (I'm also going
  to reduce the amount of hot chocolate I have, but I'm planning these
  cautions even after I resume in a scaled-down manner). Currently,
  hot chocolate is the main thing I have after which I don't brush or
  rinse. NOTE: If I have something very obvously sweet or syrupy, I
  tend to rinse because I don't like the feeling in the mouth. But hot
  chocolate may be not-sweet-enough to hit that threshold, still sweet
  enough in reality to cause damage.
