For the last week or two, I've been experiencing an increased
incidence of neck and shoulder pain. The pain isn't very acute, and it
isn't consistent through the day. It tends to be lower after physical
activity and after sleep. It seems to also be low after a bath. It
tends to be higher after sitting for extended periods of time, whether
on a chair or on the bed.

I have also noticed that the pain becomes more acute when I am
stressed and overwhelmed.

Potential contributors to the pain:

* Stress and general sense of life not getting more relaxed: Given
  that stress is the trigger for the pain to get more acute, I suspect
  that stress is also the trigger for the pain in the first place.

  Unfortunately there seems to be no direct remedy to this; taking a
  break from the stress may only increase acute stress later. In the
  last few months I've done a good job of avoiding late nights and
  intense stress events, at the cost of increased chronic sense of
  overload. I still prefer the latter to the former.
   
* Need for some diet and supplement adjustments: Although I don't
  expect it to help directly, I'm going to [start trying out omega-3
  supplements](2019-12-30-decision-to-start-taking-omega-3-supplements.md).

* Reaction to dietary changes: I recently made a number of dietary
  changes, including increasing consumption of spinach and carrots,
  and starting consumption of sauerkraut. Of these, I think the
  sauerkraut consumption, which could affect my gut bacteria, is the
  most likely to have potential negative side-effects. If it's the
  sauerkraut, I expect that after more acclimation I won't have a
  negative reaction.

* Weather-related: It's cold and rainy. I doubt this is the primary
  factor but it could be aggravating (by making me more cooped-up at
  home, closing the window more often, etc.).

* Aftereffects of traffic accident from three months ago: Some of the
  pain might be due to minor aftereffects of a [traffic accident on
  2019-09-10](https://github.com/vipulnaik/working-drafts/blob/master/traffic-accident-2019-09-10.md). Although
  I had a subjective sense of full recovery a month after the
  accident, that could have been because other factors were masking
  some of the continued pain.
