# 2022-11-30: peas past their use-by date

On Monday 2022-11-21, I bought three packs of Trader Joe's English
Shelled Peas with a use-by date of Monday 2022-11-28. I cooked
them the next day (2022-11-22). I was expecting to use the peas by
Sunday 2022-11-27. However, a little bit of the peas was left-over as
of Monday 2022-11-28. At that point, I got takeout from Mehak Indian
Cuisine, and used that for a few meals -- delaying the completion of
these peas to 2022-11-29. The marginal peas consumed were very few.

On Wednesday 2022-11-23, I bought three packs of peas with an use-by
date of Friday 2022-12-02. My expectation had been that I would cook
these around 2022-11-27 and finish them by 2022-12-02. However, due to
the slight delay in finishing the old batch, I only ended up cooking
these on Wednesday 2022-11-30. Moreover, while cooking I noticed that
one of the packs actually had a use-by date of 2022-11-28.

A few observations about the packs:

* The packs with a use-by date of 2022-12-02 appear to have been
  sprouting more than most peas, but otherwise seemed to be in good
  condition.

* The pack with a use-by date of 2022-11-28 appears to have gotten a
  little bit brown but still seemed edible and in good
  condition. Therefore, despite some reservations, I ultimately
  included it in the cooked lot. Had I noticed this pack earlier
  though (rather than seeing it at the end as it was the last pack) I
  would have cooked it separately so that I could finish it first
  before starting on the other packs.

While storing the uneaten peas after cooking, I expect to have
approximately segregated the peas with an earlier use-by date from the
peas with a later use-by date, and will focus on consuming the former
first, though the mapping won't be perfect.

All the peas tasted (and looked) fine after being cooked.

I should stay on the lookout for any signs of being unwell or food
poisoning.

It may be a bit hard to distinguish between the effects of the peas
and the recent takeout from Mehak Indian Cuisine, but I should
nonetheless be on the lookout. Moreover, I expect to focus on
consuming the peas a little faster to avoid them becoming too old,
which may itself trigger some adverse consequences (such as more gas).

## Lessons for the future

* I should check the use-by date on all pea packets both at the time
  of purchase and when cooking. This can help segregate by use-by date
  and makes sure I first consume the stuff that needs to be used
  earlier.

* If I experience nontrivial adverse consequences that seem plausibly
  connected to using the peas past their use-by date, I will adopt a
  stricter policy in the future of discarding peas past their use-by
  date (I should definitely adopt a stricter policy when cooking for
  others, but I wanted to give it a try here since I'm cooking just
  for myself, don't need to go out for any work in the next few days,
  and in general consider this sufficiently low-risk to be worth
  exploring).

* If buying peas that I do not intend to cook in the next 2 days, I
  should store them in the freezer rather than the
  refrigerator. Ideally I should move them to the refrigerator the
  night before I cook them. Keeping peas in the freezer helps them
  last longer, but it's not very pleasant to try to cook frozen peas,
  so refrigerating the night before I intend to cook them is good
  practice.
