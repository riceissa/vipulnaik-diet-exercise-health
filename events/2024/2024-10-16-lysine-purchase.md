# 2024-10-16: lysine purchase

On 2024-10-16, I purchased a two-pack of 120 capsules each of vegan
L-lysine from Amazon; the product page is
[here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BVTNNL7T/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I
decided to purchase lysine as my online research had surfaced as an
important amino acid. I've generally been interested in experimenting
with amino acid supplementation to help with muscle growth and other
benefits, as my intuition is that my dietary amino acids (from a vegan
diet) are enough for sustenance but not for adding muscle fast.

I picked up the purchased lysine on 2024-10-27, and took my first capsule
on 2024-10-27 with my evening meal.

As of 2024-10-27, my plan is to take 1 capsule daily for a week and
then reassess. After reassessment, I may go down to zero, stick to 1
daily, or do 1 with each meal (it's safe to take up to 3 daily, but it
seems recommnded to separate them across meals).
