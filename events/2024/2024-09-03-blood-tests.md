### Appointment booking with Quest Diagnostics (2024-08-28)

On Wednesday 2024-08-28, I received an email from Quest Diagnostics
confirming that they had received the order. I proceeded to book an
appointment with Quest Diagnostics. I chose a date of Tuesday
2024-09-03, which was the earliest date wth an available
appointment. I chose a time of 10:10 AM, which was the earliest
available time, although I likely would not have picked a much earlier
time in any case.

### Setup of calendar reminders

I set all my calendar reminders based on the blood test time.

## Preparatory steps

### Pausing of supplements (2024-09-01 onward)

On Saturday 2024-08-31, after the morning supplement consumption, I
packed the supplements from my table into a plastic bag so that I
would not accidentally consume them starting the next day.

Starting Sunday 2024-09-01, I stopped consuming all supplements.

### Trader Joe's trip (2024-09-01)

On Sunday 2024-09-01, in the early afternoon, I finished my last
Trader Joe's trip prior to the appointment, stocking enough food that
I would not need to go shopping to Trader Joe's for 48 hours after the
blood test. However, I might still end up getting more vegan yogurt
from Berkeley Bowl, which is close by and relatively light.

### Weather check (2024-09-01 evening)

On the evening of 2024-09-01, I did a weather check to confirm that
the weather for the time of my appointment was fine.

### Skipping of all exercise (2024-09-02 onward)

On 2024-09-02, the day prior to the blood test, I am skipping all
exercise.

### End of meal the previous evening (2024-09-02)

I finished my main meal at 7:16 PM. I last ate a little bit of food at
7:40 PM as part of cleanup.
