# 2024-10-16: n-acetyl cysteine purchase

On 2024-10-16, I purchased [n-acetyl cysteine with
selenium](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OUQ3S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). After
picking up on 2024-10-27, I decided to pause on starting this as I
wanted to get started on [lysine](2024-10-16-lysine-purchase.md)
first, and I wanted to stagger the starts to get a clearer picture of
effects.

On 2024-11-05, I started the n-acetyl cysteine at 1 capsule per
day. My plan is to stick to 1 capsule per day unless I notice any
adverse effects or get new information that suggests increasing the
doage to 2 per day.
