# 2024-03-18: right middle finger below nail: unexpected cut and bleeding

On 2024-03-18, I went to the Amazon Hub Locker at ASUC Berkeley to
pick up packages. For this, I had to carry my suitcase. I toggled the
suitcase between my hands often.

When I arrived at the location, I saw blood on my middle finger back
(below my nail), on the nail, and on the middle finger front and
thumb. I was able to wipe off the blood from most places with
sanitizer; the place where it didn't get wiped was the source, and
this was the area below the right middle nail. Apparently there was a
little cut that may have existed before, but it opened up enough to
start bleeding.

I'm not sure of the reason. Maybe the frequent collision with the zips
during the transfers irritated and opened up the wound?

After I got home and washed my hands twice, the clotted blood was
wiped off. Only the original cut was visible very faintly. I applied
vaseline to the cut and it seems like it's not bleeding more for
now. Given the location, it's not very feasible to apply a bandage as
the bandage will get in the way of handwashing and using my hands for
typing and eating.
