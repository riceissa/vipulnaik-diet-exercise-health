# 2024-09-20: anal swelling

See also [2021-09-12 anal swelling](../2021/2021-09-12-anal-swelling.md).

## Initial symptoms and development

On the evening of 2024-09-20, I noticed a slight itching pain in my
lower anus. The itch largely happened only when I contracted the area
using my muscles, but I also felt an urge to do this contraction.

On inspection, there was a bit of swelling in the area where I was
experiencing the itch.

I had a normal bowel movement the next day (2024-09-21) and no clear
increase in effort, discomfort, or pain for bowel movement. There was
also bleeding while wiping the area. The sensations in the area were
subdued during and before the bowel movement, and were greatest when
my bowel was empty.

## Strategies from last time to consider

Here are some learnings from last time. I think the overall itch /
pain is less this time (so far) so these may not be applicable as is:

* Thinking consciously about it tended to correlate with expanding or
  contracting too much.
* Expanding or contracting a little bit tended to address the itch
  without causing pain, but I didn't adopt that as a strategy because
  I often lost control and ended up doing too much.

* One trick was to go in the opposite direction as my itch; if I felt
  like contracting, expand. This made it a bit less likely that I
  would overshoot.

## Possible causes and aggravating factors

* On 2024-09-18, two days before the start of the itching, I had Udupi
  Palace spinach masala dosa takeout for the first time after almost
  five months (my last takeout was 2024-04-24, before my [first round
  of abdominal pain](2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md)). While in the past
  I've been very used to this level of consumption, my body may be
  unused to it now and this may have put more of a strain on my anus.

* I've been having ongoing abdominal discomfort issues over the past
  two months that I've been gadually recovering from, but have not
  fully recovered from. See
  [here](2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md)
  for details.

## Comparison with last time

My [previous experience](../2021/2021-09-12-anal-swelling.md) seems
similar, but based on both my documentation and my memory of the time,
it had been more painful that time. With that said, the previous time,
the pain started on 2021-09-12 and bleeding was observed on
2021-09-15, three days later, so there is still a possibility of a
worsening trajectory. However, there are a few things different:

* Last time, I had a need to suppress urination and bowel movement due
  to a toilet clog, that likely worsened symptoms.

* Both last time and this time, I suspect that recent outside food
  consumption (Mehak Indian Cuisine last time, Udupi Palace this time)
  played a causal role. However, last time, I had continued finishing
  up that outside food for days, whereas this time I had just one
  Udupi Palace meal and that's it.

* On the flip side though, this time I am still dealing with /
  recovering from abdominal discomfort issues that might be feeding
  the problem more.

* Related to the above, last time, my overall frequency of having
  outside food, both from Mehak Indian Cuisine and Udupi Palace, was
  quite high, which migh be good (as my GI tract was more designed to
  digest the food) and bad (if it led to systematic erosion of some
  capabilities).
