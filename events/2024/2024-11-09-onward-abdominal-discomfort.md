# 2024-11-09 onward: abdominal discomfort

On the evening of Saturday 2024-11-09, after doing a lengthy call, I
noticed various symptoms of overexertion, including slight sore
throat, neck fatigue, greater light sensitivity, and some abdominal
discomfort. I took all the recommended precautions, including pausing
sauerkraut and walnuts.

On the morning of 2024-11-10, most of the symptoms had subsided, but
some form of intermittent abdominal discomfort persisted, and I also
got a litle bit of anal itching. I took prompt action around the anal
itching and this too mostly subsided by the evening and into the next
day.

By the morning of 2024-11-11, abdominal discomfort was the only clear
surviving symptom. The qualia had shifted from a bloating sensation to
a cramping sensation.

By the morning of 2024-11-12, the abdominal discomfort had largely
cleared; any residual discomfort was not different from levels seen
under normal fluctuation. So, I am considering the incident closed.

## Theories as to potential causes

* Overexertion in the call on Saturday was a likely trigger but not
  the root cause.

* Recent Udupi Palace spinach masala dosa consumption which had higher
  spice content and also more FODMAPs than usual (lentils that may not
  have been fully soaked, plus onions).

* High FODMAP consumption in general, as part of efforts to have more
  protein, though I do try to do as much draining as possible to
  reduce FODMAP content in cooked lentils.

* It's possible that the cold temperatures at night may be playing a
  role, but the mechanism is unclear (and this was not a factor in
  othe recent cases of abdominal discomfort).
