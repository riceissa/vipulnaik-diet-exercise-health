# 2024-09-27 onward: minor inflammation of lower neck

## Initial symptoms and progression

### 2024-09-27

At night on 2024-09-27, while having a bath, I noticed that the hot
water was irritating my lower neck area right around the clavicle. The
irritation was off and on, and when I looked in the mirror, I didn't
see anything at the skin level, so I assumed it was an internal strain
of some sort.

### 2024-09-28

At night on 2024-09-28, I noticed a red inflammation, of the sort that
I might get with a bite, in the lower neck at the center (not left or
right) with a "bite" site and a bit of redness surrounding it. This
was weird because as far as I remembered I had not been bitten or
encountered any stimulus of the sort.

Separately, earlier in the day on 2024-09-28, I had noticed a little
sore/boil/pimple on the right side of my neck (this is an area at the edge of
where I shave, but I don't think it was induced by shaving -- but it
might have been). All the others were *not* within the area I
regularly shave as part of face shaving and the timing of those is
definitely not explained by recent shaving.

I tried to take photos with my phone camera but it did not have the
ability for high resolution at such close range.

### 2024-09-29

On the morning of 2024-09-29, I put a water block flex bandage over
the bite-like area and an ordinary bandage over the sore/boil/pimple
on the lower neck.

In the evening, I took off the ordinary bandage over the
sore/boil/pimple, but kept the water block flex bandage on. The water
block flex bandage survived my bath without any dislodging. Seems like
waterproof bandages basically work as advertised when not on the hands!

### 2024-09-30

The water block flex bandage appears to have survived overnight and is
still intact in the morning. It stayed intact throughout the day. I
didn't experience any further inflammation in the area

### 2024-10-01

I took the water block flex bandage off around 10 AM, about 48 hours
after I had put it on. There was still a bit of a red dot but no
surrounding redness. My plan was to keep the area open for a few hours
and after that I will likely put anothe water block flex bandage on
the area. I wanted to leave the area open a little bit to make sure
there is no maceration and to let the surrounding skin breathe.

At around 1 PM, I put a new water block flex bandage on.

## 2024-10-02

I took the water block flex bandage off at around 9:25 PM.

I put a new bandage on at around 11:20 PM. I oriented the new bandage
horizontally instead of vertically, as there was some more minor
inflammation to the right, and also I wanted the area above to breathe
given that it had been bandaged (with brief breaks) for the past 3.5
days.

## 2024-10-04

I took the water block flex bandage off at around 9:10 PM.

I can see an imprint of the active portion of the bandage. Also, the
area of the bite-like cut now seems more healed, with white stuff on
top. Removing the bandage has raised my sensation in the area, so it's
suggesting I need to re-bandage it after waiting a little while to get
the surrounding skin to breathe.

I applied vaseline over the area.

I applied a new bandage at around 9:35 PM as I was feeling itching in
the area that hadn't been present while the previous bandage had been
on. The itching stopped shortly after applying the new bandage.

## 2024-10-05

At around 10:30 PM, I removed and immediately re-applied the water
block flex bandage, changing its orientation a little bit to cover a
reddening slightly above the area covered by the bandage. The bite
area itself seems to have healed quite well, per the brief glimpse of
it I got in between the removal and the re-application.

However, around midnight, I removed the bandage entirely as it felt
like it was getting in the way more than helping; the re-applied
bandage seemed to not properly cover the original bite area anyway,
perhaps because I had applied it incorrectly or it moved a little bit.

## Muscle strain as a potential explanation

Currently, the most likely potential explanation is that in the last
few days, I've ramped up the frequency and intensity of my efforts
with the 200 lb hand gripper. These efforts may have caused some
strain to my head and neck muscles that was not immediately obvious.

My plan is to stay away from the 200 lb hand gripper for a little bit,
and to instead look into other exercises to generally improve head and
neck strength, while separately improving finger and wrist strength by
doing the 100 lb hand gripper with fewer fingers. Within a few days,
it will hopefully become clear if stopping the 200 lb hand gripper
allows for recovery. If necessary, I will also pause the 100 lb and
150 lb hand grippers.

On 2024-10-15, I found a [Reddit

and [linked YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxR3RQ0W-7M) that explains how
the muscles at the base of the neck are important for grip strength.
