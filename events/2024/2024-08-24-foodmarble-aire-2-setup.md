## Setup process

I had already installed the FoodMarble app on my phone on 2024-08-21
as part of my purchase decision process.

I started the unpacking process at around 5 PM.

So, after unpacking the FoodMarble Aire 2 box, I first started
charging it a little bit using the USB cable in the box. Then after
that, I tried going to the FoodMarble app and tried to find the
device. It didn't work initially, so I realized I need to keep the
button on the device pressed during the search. I did that, and the
pairing with the device worked.

Per the instructions in the app, I then cleaned the mouthpiece that
needs to be blown into.

I then followed the instructions in the app to do my first two test
breaths, after which I then did a "real" breath and got an initial set
of readings.

This experience would lead me to later document my best practices for
the breath testing process
[here](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-foodmarble-aire-2-breath-testing.md).

## Update 2024-08-25: exhale recognition seems to have stopped

On 2024-08-25, when I tried doing a breath test at around 2 PM (this
would be my seventh breath test) I cancelled my first attempt because
I started exhaling too early. However, after that cancellation, future
attempts just didn't work; for whatever reason the device seemed to
fail to recognize my exhale and kept telling me to exhale. I tried a
few times with gaps of 20 minutes and continued running into the same
issue. Charging the battery to full or doing the [hard
reset](https://support.foodmarble.com/en/article/aire-2-troubleshooting-hard-reset-fqkgpc/)
didn't seem to fix the problem.

I'm planning to wait a little while and try again, and then reach out
to their support email address (`hello@foodmarble.com`) and/or ask
about it on Reddit if the problem persists. As of now I am not sure if
the issue was caused by my initial cancel or if it is some kind of
hardware issue. And if it's the latter, whether waiting a little while
would fix it (for instance, if there's moisture accumulated in the
device, then waiting a while for it to dry should address the
moisture).
