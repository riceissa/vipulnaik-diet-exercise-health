## Setup process

I had already installed the FoodMarble app on my phone on 2024-08-21
as part of my purchase decision process.

I started the unpacking process at around 5 PM.

So, after unpacking the FoodMarble Aire 2 box, I first started
charging it a little bit using the USB cable in the box. Then after
that, I tried going to the FoodMarble app and tried to find the
device. It didn't work initially, so I realized I need to keep the
button on the device pressed during the search. I did that, and the
pairing with the device worked.

Per the instructions in the app, I then cleaned the mouthpiece that
needs to be blown into.

I then followed the instructions in the app to do my first two test
breaths, after which I then did a "real" breath and got an initial set
of readings.

This experience would lead me to later document my best practices for
the breath testing process
[here](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-foodmarble-aire-2-breath-testing.md).
