# 2024-09-28: decision to experimentally add another omega-3 supplement

This is a followup to [2024-09-25: decision to increase omega-3
supplement daily
dose](2024-09-25-decision-to-increase-omega-3-supplement-daily-dose.md). See
the Addendum section of that document for where I left off before
getting into this document.

## Reasons for getting a new supplement

There were two factors influencing my decision:

* Even with doubling my Freshfield omega-3 dose I would still be at
  just 520 mg, compared to my soft limit of about 1 gram, so there
  would be room to supplement more.

* Freshfield has DHA and DPA but not EPA. While DPA is believed by
  some to be a potentially superior substitute for EPA, EPA has been
  more widely studied and demonstrated to have benefits. It would be
  good to add another supplement that is more focused on EPA.

I decided to go for the [sapling vegan
omega-3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZQ3FWBZ/). I placed the
order and will start consumption once I receive the supplement.

My current plan is to do 2 doses each of Freshfield and sapling
everyday, but if I sense potential adverse reactions my plan is to
drop down to doing 2 doses of Freshfield and 2 doses of sapling each
on alternating days.
