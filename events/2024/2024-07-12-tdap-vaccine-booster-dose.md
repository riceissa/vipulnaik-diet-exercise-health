## Appointment booking (2024-07-06)

My previous vaccine booster dose had been on 2014-12-15, so I had a
reminder set for July 2024 to look into getting a booster dose (a
booster dose is recommended every 10 years). The reminder was on my
calendar for 2024-07-13, but I decided to tackle it on 2024-07-06. So,
I went to the Walgreens website and booked the appointment.

As is typical for vaccine appointments, I chose Friday 2024-07-12 3
PM, to give myself adequate recovery time after the vaccination.

I also had to fill in a questionnaire disclosing when I got my most
recent vaccine, for which I entered 12/2014.

The instructions ask me to arrive 15 minutes prior to the appointment
and bring my insurance card.

I created a calendar event and invited my work account so that it
blocks that time on my calendar.

Shortly after this, I wrote down the [best practices around vaccine
appointments
doc](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
and created a bunch of calendar reminders based on the guidance I was
assembling.

## Appointment (2024-07-12)

### Arrival and initial process (2:33 PM to 2:40 PM)

I arrived at the Walgreens pharmacy counter at 2:33 PM. Unlike the
last couple of times I have gone for vaccine appointments, I didn't
have to wait in line at all. This is likely because I arrived a little
earlier (the line tends to start building up around 2:40 PM). Unlike
the last two times, I did not see or hear any evidence that their
computer systems were slow today, so that could also be a reason there
wasn't a line.

I was called to the counter; I explained that I was here for a Tdap
vaccine at 3 PM. After they checked their system and confirmed the
appointment, they asked me for my ID card, which I provided.

After that, I was asked to fill in answers to three questions (am I
sick today, have I had COVID-19 in the past two weeks, and have I been
a close contact of somebody with COVID-19 in the past two weeks) and
to sign the document. The signature date on the document was
2024-07-06, the date I had booked the appointment, rather than the
current date.

My insurance covered the vaccine, so I did not need to make
a payment.

The process finished at 2:40 PM. I received the booklet from Walgreens
that stated that the intended processing time was 2:51 PM. I then
waited for my vaccine dose.

### Waiting before vaccine (2:40 PM to 2:52 PM)

Over this time period, I was waiting outside the vaccination
room. While waiting, I went through the booklet provided by
Walgreens. It described the medication as Boostrix 0.5ml IM PFS (10
pack) with directions to "administer 0.5ml in the muscle".

### Vaccine (2:52 PM to 2:54 PM)

I was called into the room to get my vaccine at 2:52 PM. I went
in.

For confirmation, the pharmacist asked for my date of birth and asked
for my confirmation that I'm getting the Tdap vaccine.

The chair was arranged in a way that the left arm would be the one to
apply the vaccine, so I told the pharmacist that I wanted the vaccine
on my right arm, so she turned the chair around. I then took off my
bag and sat in the chair.

She then asked me to pull up my shirt sleeve, which I did.

After that, she applied the vaccine and then a bandage. I reconfirmed
the vaccine and then collected my bag, checked my pockets, and exited
the room.

She asked me to stay in the store for 15 minutes to monitor for
adverse effects.

I checked the time on my phone right after exiting; it was 2:54 PM.

### Waiting (2:54 PM to 3:09 PM)

I waited in a seated area outside the vaccination room from 2:54 PM to
3 PM. During this initial period, I was not wearing my bag. I used my
phone for a little while and also moved my arms around a little bit
and rubbed on the vaccine injection site briefly.

I then got up and started shopping. I finished checkout for
shopping at 3:07 PM, then bagged the stuff I had purchased and left
around 3:09 PM, as intended.
