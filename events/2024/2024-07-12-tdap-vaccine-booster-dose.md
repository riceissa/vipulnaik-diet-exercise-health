## Appointment booking (2024-07-06)

My previous vaccine booster dose had been on 2014-12-15, so I had a
reminder set for July 2024 to look into getting a booster dose (a
booster dose is recommended every 10 years). The reminder was on my
calendar for 2024-07-13, but I decided to tackle it on 2024-07-06. So,
I went to the Walgreens website and booked the appointment.

As is typical for vaccine appointments, I chose Friday 2024-07-12 3
PM, to give myself adequate recovery time after the vaccination.

I also had to fill in a questionnaire disclosing when I got my most
recent vaccine, for which I entered 12/2014.

The instructions ask me to arrive 15 minutes prior to the appointment
and bring my insurance card.

I created a calendar event and invited my work account so that it
blocks that time on my calendar.

Shortly after this, I wrote down the [best practices around vaccine
appointments
doc](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
and created a bunch of calendar reminders based on the guidance I was
assembling.
