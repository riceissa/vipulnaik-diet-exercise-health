The vaccine doesn't seem to have caused significant changes to blood
pressure and heart rate; this is consistent with my subjective
experience.

## Appointment booking (2024-07-06)

My previous vaccine booster dose had been on 2014-12-15, so I had a
reminder set for July 2024 to look into getting a booster dose (a
booster dose is recommended every 10 years). The reminder was on my
calendar for 2024-07-13, but I decided to tackle it on 2024-07-06. So,
I went to the Walgreens website and booked the appointment.

As is typical for vaccine appointments, I chose Friday 2024-07-12 3
PM, to give myself adequate recovery time after the vaccination.

I also had to fill in a questionnaire disclosing when I got my most
recent vaccine, for which I entered 12/2014.

The instructions ask me to arrive 15 minutes prior to the appointment
and bring my insurance card.

I created a calendar event and invited my work account so that it
blocks that time on my calendar.

Shortly after this, I wrote down the [best practices around vaccine
appointments
doc](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
and created a bunch of calendar reminders based on the guidance I was
assembling.

## Appointment (2024-07-12)

### Arrival and initial process (2:33 PM to 2:40 PM)

I arrived at the Walgreens pharmacy counter at 2:33 PM. Unlike the
last couple of times I have gone for vaccine appointments, I didn't
have to wait in line at all. This is likely because I arrived a little
earlier (the line tends to start building up around 2:40 PM). Unlike
the last two times, I did not see or hear any evidence that their
computer systems were slow today, so that could also be a reason there
wasn't a line.

I was called to the counter; I explained that I was here for a Tdap
vaccine at 3 PM. After they checked their system and confirmed the
appointment, they asked me for my ID card, which I provided.

After that, I was asked to fill in answers to three questions (am I
sick today, have I had COVID-19 in the past two weeks, and have I been
a close contact of somebody with COVID-19 in the past two weeks) and
to sign the document. The signature date on the document was
2024-07-06, the date I had booked the appointment, rather than the
current date.

My insurance covered the vaccine, so I did not need to make
a payment.

The process finished at 2:40 PM. I received the booklet from Walgreens
that stated that the intended processing time was 2:51 PM. I then
waited for my vaccine dose.

### Waiting before vaccine (2:40 PM to 2:52 PM)

Over this time period, I was waiting outside the vaccination
room. While waiting, I went through the booklet provided by
Walgreens. It described the medication as Boostrix 0.5ml IM PFS (10
pack) with directions to "administer 0.5ml in the muscle".

### Vaccine (2:52 PM to 2:54 PM)

I was called into the room to get my vaccine at 2:52 PM. I went
in.

For confirmation, the pharmacist asked for my date of birth and asked
for my confirmation that I'm getting the Tdap vaccine.

The chair was arranged in a way that the left arm would be the one to
apply the vaccine, so I told the pharmacist that I wanted the vaccine
on my right arm, so she turned the chair around. I then took off my
bag and sat in the chair.

She then asked me to pull up my shirt sleeve, which I did.

After that, she applied the vaccine and then a bandage. I reconfirmed
the vaccine and then collected my bag, checked my pockets, and exited
the room.

She asked me to stay in the store for 15 minutes to monitor for
adverse effects.

I checked the time on my phone right after exiting; it was 2:54 PM.

### Waiting (2:54 PM to 3:09 PM)

I waited in a seated area outside the vaccination room from 2:54 PM to
3 PM. During this initial period, I was not wearing my bag. I used my
phone for a little while and also moved my arms around a little bit
and rubbed on the vaccine injection site briefly.

I then got up and started shopping. I finished checkout for
shopping at 3:07 PM, then bagged the stuff I had purchased and left
around 3:09 PM, as intended.

## Aftereffects

### The few hours after the vaccine (2024-07-12)

I was able to carry back home a mild load of stuff purchased from
Walgreens without any issues. Over the next few hours, I observed a
slight increase in soreness in the area. This also made it a little
unpleasant to lift heavy stuff with my right arm; the situation where
this came up organically was when I was moving around the (partly
filled) stainless steel pot for cooking rice.

### Sleep (night going from 2024-07-12 to 2024-07-130)

I had a fairly normal sleep. The only unusual aspect was that when
sleeping on my right side, unlike the normal position where my arm is
under my body and supporting a large proportion of the weight of the
upper body, I gravitated towards positions where the arm was on the
side, so that the body was directly resting on the bed and the arm was
only supporting its own weight. In contrast, when sleeping on the left
side, I continued to have my usual posture.

### The next morning (2024-07-13)

I felt fairly normal the next morning, albeit perhaps a little less
energetic than usual, which might reflect that some of my body's
energy had gone into responding to the vaccine. I took blood pressure
/ heart rate and temperature readings, which were fairly normal.

It helped that the weather was cooler on this day than on previous
days.

I did go out for a brief shopping trip to Walgreens, which didn't
involve carrying back a heavy load so it was okay. Other than that, I
stayed home. As for physical exercise, I only did the
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise.

In terms of cognitive demands, it was a typical day.

I removed the bandage around 9 PM in the evening.

### Two days later (2024-07-14)

This was a fairly normal day, other than the fact that I skipped all
physical exercise.

In terms of cognitive demands, it was a typical day, albeit my flow
was better.

By the evening, I noticed that the soreness had spread out to a wider
area around the injection site, and I also noticed a slight neck and
shoulder pain, My guess is that it would have been worse if I had done
hand gripper exercises or strength exercises, but since I refrained
from them, the pain was mild and didn't really inconvenience me.

### Three days later (2024-07-15)

I resumed breath holds and jogging on this day. I was able to jog my
target minimum of a little over 1.4 miles, though it was less than my
usual of 1.5-1.7 miles.
