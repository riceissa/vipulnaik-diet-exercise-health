# 2024-06-19: flatulence

On 2024-06-19, I had a higher level of flatulence than usual in the
afternoon. However, I was able to overcome the flatulence prior to my
outside trip. There continued to be a little flatulence in the
evening, but it was not as much as in the afternoon.

Unlike previous incidents, the flatulence was not accompanied by much
pain.

Possible reasons include:

* Overexercise -- I ran a little longer than I have run in previous
  days, which might have caused fatigue
* More-than-usual consumption of kale and broccoli as part of my meal,
  which might have aggravated the flatuence (I have these regularly,
  but just the parts of my stored food that I was having were heavier
  in kale and broccoli than usual)
* Doing a breath hold after my meal rather than early in the morning
  (prior to jogging) as I usually do
* Probably a little bit less than a full bowel
  movement in the morning, likely due to a little undersleep
