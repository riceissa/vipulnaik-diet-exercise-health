# 2024-07-07: lemon consumption and increased burping

On 2024-07-07, I added in the remainder of the lemon (from which I had
been squeezing drops for the past few meal preps) into my potatoes
prep.

While I didn't have it all with the portion of the potatoes prep I
consumed today, I did have a more lemon-heavy meal today, as the lemon
had been added on top and I was eating the potatoes prep from the top.

I noticed slightly increased stomach discomfort and also some burping,
with lemon flavor in the burp.

This might be a result of the lemon's acidity, as well as the slightly
reduced sleep in the last few days due to heat making it hard to sleep
until past midnight.

One embarrassing thing was that one of the burps late at night also
caused me to let out a small amount of spit that landed on my shorts.
