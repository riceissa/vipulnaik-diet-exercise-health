# 2024 blood test plans

This page documents the thought process behind deciding on my blood
tests, as well as the process of getting them.

## Test shortlist for phase 1 of tests (targeted for around August/September 2024)

I started working on this test shortlist in November 2023. I later
updated it in late August 2024 prior to ordering.

Total estimated cost: LabCorp: $445; Quest Diagnostics: $431. I went
with Quest Diagnostics.

### Insulin: followup measurement because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

My previous insulin test came back fairly normal (3.6). So this
followup is only being done due to family diabetic tendencies, and the
importance ascribed in certain circles to insulin testing.

### HbA1c with eAG: followup measurement because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $39)

My last HbA1c test, in June 2021, came back pretty good at 5.0%. So,
this followup test is mostly just in light of the need to continue to
monitor this due to family diabetic tendencies.

I have continued to maintain a diet low in direct sugar content, with
most of my sugars coming through their natural occurrence in my
vegetables, so I do not expect my HbA1c to have deteriorated
significantly. But with a three-year gap it's good to get another
test.

### Lipid panel: followup measurement because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/lipid-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $36)

In the previous lipid panel, done 2021, my triglycerides were a tad
higher than I'd like, and the LDL might also have been a bit higher
than desired. The triglyceride:HDL ratio was also concerning. Given
these considerations, and family diabetic tendencies, it seems
worthwhile to get a lipid panel done. I do expect that my diet,
exercise, and stress level changes since then have been for the
better, but general age-related deterioration pushes in the other
direction.

### Omega-3: followup measurement to test the success of supplementation and dietary changes

Test details: https://requestatest.com/omega-3-blood-test (LabCorp: $129; Quest Diagnostics: $129)

I [started omega-3
supplementation](../2019/2019-12-30-decision-to-start-taking-omega-3-supplements.md)
in early 2020. I got my first test results in 2021, where I was okay
but below optimal. Since then, I've made further changes including the
addition of walnuts to my diet. This followup test is to assess the
success of those changes.

### Vitamin panel, basic (B12, D, and folate)

Test details: https://requestatest.com/basic-vitamin-deficiency-panel-vitamin-b12-d-folate-blood-test (LabCorp: $125; Quest Diagnostics: $109)

I decided to get tested for these as a package since it's cheaper than
testing the components individually, and considering that I have been
continuing to supplement Vitamin D and B12.

### CBC with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details: https://requestatest.com/complete-blood-count-cbc-and-comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp-blood-test (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $59)

I'm getting these tests done both due to not feeling well now, and to
get another followup measurement after my April tests (which were not
done with the proper fasting).


## Test shortlist for phase 2 of tests (targeted for around August/September of 2024)

NOTE: If my lipid panel, HbA1c, or insulin test results are concerning,
I may end up deferring these tests in order to be able to combine them
with a followup lipid panel measurement.

### Magnesium-zinc-copper panel

Test details: https://requestatest.com/mag-zinc-copper-panel-testing (LabCorp: $125; Quest Diagnostics: $125)

My primary interest is in magnesium and zinc, but the other parts of the panel don't hurt.

### Creatine

Test details: https://requestatest.com/creatine-blood-test (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $89)

I haven't been tested before for this (according to my records), but I
did get a test for the related creatinine, where I was below the
expected range. However, the creatinine test was mainly to detect
being *above* the relevant range.

Creatine is something that vegans are expected to be deficient in. In
2021, I skipped the testing as I was not planning to start on
supplementation even conditional to being deficient. Now that I've
been doing strength exercises more regularly, I think I'm prepared to
start supplementation if deficient, and the test results might inform
the dose I use to supplement.

## Tests that didn't make the cut

Below are some tests that I've had previously, that I decided not to get again:

Test details:

* Hepatic function https://requestatest.com/hepatic-function-testing
  (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $29): My main interest is in ALT
  (as an indication of fatty liver disease). The most significant
  parts of this are covered in the CMP test.

* https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-testing
  and https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-quantitative-testing
  because they don't seem necessary yet, and because I got a normal
  result for the latter in 2016.

## More expensive niche tests to investigate for the future

* Organic acid test: https://requestatest.com/organic-acid-urine-test
  (LabCorp: $429): A very interesting test, but I need to see if I
  should get it done from a more specialized company that offers a
  more detailed diagnostic report, such as Genova Diagnostics
  (https://connect.gdx.net/products/nutrition-organic-acids/) ($289).

* TrioSmart three-gas test https://www.triosmartbreath.com/orderonline
  ($349).
