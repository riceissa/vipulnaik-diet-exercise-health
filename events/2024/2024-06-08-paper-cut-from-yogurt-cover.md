# 2024-06-08: paper cut from yogurt cover

This was on 2024-06-08 around 1 AM.

## Time of cut (before going to sleep) on 2024-06-08

## How the cut happened

I had finished consuming my vegan probiotic yogurt (Kite Hill
Unsweetened). I was rinsing the container to leave it to dry for later
addition to the recycling.

The container has a paper wrapper on top, which I peeled off, washed,
and threw in the trash. What I didn't notice is that there were small
amounts of the wrapper left on the edges, and they had sharp edges
(the small amount of wrapper was visible, but the sharpness of the
edges wasn't clear).

When rinsing, I moved my left hand toward the side with the sharp
edges. The thing that hit it first was the outer front side of my left
index finger, right above the metacarpo-phalangeal joint.

## Immediate aftermath

I immediately felt sharp pain in the area, as well as disappointment
for having gotten a paper cut twice in a week. I tried pressing and
washing, but it was too late -- the cut started bleeding in a minute,
and I had to put a bandage around it.

## Next few hours

I waited some time (15-30 minutes?) and then opened the bandage to
check. Hemostasis had occurred, but the area was raw, and wetting my
hands while brushing my teeth led to a little further bleeding, so it
was necessary to keep another bandage. Unfortunately, I also
discovered that the location of the injury meant that a bandage
wouldn't be stable under handwashing, so I washed and dried my hands
and then put on a new bandage. I went to sleep around 2:15 AM with the
bandage.

## 2024-06-08 after waking up

### Morning immediately after waking up

I woke up around 7:45 AM and checked. There was still a scar but it
was stable enough that I could run water over it, wash my hands,
etc. without it getting too agitated. Given that bandages would
intrfere with my regular activities during the day, I decided to keep
the bandage off during the day while at home, with the possibility of
putting it back on at night or when doing some tasks like carrying
stuff where the area might get irritated.

## Early evening: brief bleeding again due to agitation

For most of the day, the cut seemed fairly okay, and in particular I
was able to wah dishes, rinse, floss, and wash my hands without
issues. However, during the very end of doing my regular laundry,
something happened, probably the laundry bag's edge ticked the thing,
and it briefly bled again. The bleeding was one-off and it seemed to
stop bleeding after that, but I in any case bandaged it in preparation
for an outside trip (my plan had been to bandage it right before
heading out, but the brief re-bleeding made me bandage it a bit
sooner).

### Late evening: success with waterproof bandage

In the evening, on the way to Trader Joe's, I stopped by Walgreens to
stock up on bandages. While looking through the bandages, I noticed
waterproof bandages so I decided to buy those (along with strong
bandages). After returning home, I switched from my existing bandage
to a waterproof bandage. I then proceeded to keep the bandage on while
I cooked, washed my hands, and washed dishes. Overall, it didn't get
too loose with water, except during a period where I was exposing it
to water continuoudly. But even in that case,, it dried out within a
few minutes.

### Night

I kept the same waterproof bandage on at night. However, it seems to
have come off some time during the night, likely due to the weakening
after extensive use of water, hand soap, dish soap, etc. over the
previous evening.

### Morning

Even before I fully woke up, I noticed that the waterproof bandage was
no longer on my finger. I found that it was crumpled up on the bed
nearby, so it must have come off, likely due to the weakening over the
previous evening. The wound situation seemed fairly similar to
yesterday, with no very clear improvement.

I put a new bandage on shortly after waking up.

### Afternoon

At around 2:30 PM, about 6.5 hours after I had put it on, and
including dishwashing activities, etc. the waterproof bandage came
off. I put a new bandage on. After a few hours, this second one had
loosened, though it hadn't totally come off.

### Evening

I went out to buy bandages. When I came back, I replaced my now-loose
bandage with the Band-Aid Water Block Flex, which is supposed to be
better. Unfortunately, for the first two bandages, I didn't actually
stretch the bandage to form a good seal. With the third bandage I
stretched it and it formed a good seal, and it seems to have held up
well; provisionally it seemed to provide better water-blocking than the
previous set of waterproof bandages.

The bandage came off just before my bath, so I put a new Water Block
Flex bandage on. The new bandage survived through my bath but I had to
change to a new one. This time, I picked the original bandage type
(from Walgreens).

When I woke up, the bandage was still intact. However, it did get
loose after a while. I had switched it twice as of 2 PM.

I used up the third bandage at 8 PM, after finishing eating. The skin
around the wound (that I have to bandage around) [skin
maceration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_maceration) under the
bandage, I decided to leave the area unbandaged for a while. Since the
wound itself seems to have healed enough and doesn't seem to be
getting inflamed, my current plan is to leave the wound open most of
the day, but bandage it when doing some actviity where I'm likely to
rub the wound in a way that might agitate it, such as outdoor trips
where I'm carrying bags with my fingers, laundry trips where I'm
carrying laundry bags, jogging trips, and shower/bath.
