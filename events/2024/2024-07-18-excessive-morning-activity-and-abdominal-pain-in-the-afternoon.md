# 2024-07-18: excessive morning activity and abdominal pain in the afternoon

## Summary of symptoms

Overall, this was a case of intermittent abdominal pain, along with
other symptoms that fall in the LEGIT category but don't rise to the
level of SERIOUS:

* More burping than usual (LEGIT)

* Occasional flatulence, generally very small amounts (LEGIT)

* Audible abdominal activity in some mornings (LEGIT)

* Abdominal heaviness (subjective)

There were no serious symptoms such as bloating, muscle guarding,
palpation pain, and rebound tenderness. There was no clear disruption
to my bowel movement cycle, bowel characteristics, or urine
characteristics.

The effect on my overall productivity and output was minimal except to the extent that my increased sleep time reduces my hours o do work; if
anything my output in the beginning (before I started enforcing more sleep) was a little higher than usual though that was
probably for unrelated reasons.

The symptoms mostly correlated with each other, so were highest
together and receded together.

## Background from the previous night

It's rather hot during the afternoon, and I needed to stock up on
food, so in anticipation of needing to go out shopping in the morning,
I went to sleep a little earlier (by about 1.5 hours) compared to my
usual. Specifically, I went to sleep around 10:30 PM, compared to the
past few days of about midnight (ironically, the late sleeping time in
the recent past was itself driven by the heat making it hard to go to
sleep earlier).

## Background on morning activity

I woke up around 6:40 AM, about 1.5 hours earlier than usual, which
was likely because of sleeping earlier.

Since I woke up early enough, I decided to both go jogging *and* do my
morning shopping trip.

I needed to be back home for a meeting at 10:30 AM. The way this ended
up working out is that I went jogging from 8:20 AM to 8:45 AM, then
got back and headed out pretty quickly thereafter shortly after 9
AM. I got back around 10:20 AM, just in time for my meeting.

Overall, I walked + jogged almost 5 miles, with jogging making up
about 1.7 miles. Fortunately, I didn't carry back a heavy load of
stuff. But keep in mind that this 5 miles was before I had eaten
anything in the morning.

Then, after coming back home, I did my meeting, then wrapped up a few
items, then proceeded with my potatoes prep. I was finally done and
started eating my first meal of the day at around 1:15 PM. I also did
a meeting with a couple of work colleagues while eating, and the
eating and meeting wrapped up around 2:20 PM.

Given the large amount of running + walking, I probably ended up
eating a bit more than usual.

## Experience later in the afternoon

I felt heaviness in my abdomen (likely my stomach area) and didn't
feel very energetic. Later, that translated to a bit of abdominal
pain. The pain was lesser when standing and moving around.

A few other complications:

* It was a little hot but not too hot in the afternoon, which may have
  added to my fatigue and lethargy.

* The meal itself had potatoes, peas, broccoli, kale, and sauerkraut,
  all of which can be heavy on the stomach. But it was my typical meal
  -- nothing unusual.

* In the previous days, I had experienced some stomach discomfort due
  to excess lemon consumption and the consumption of lentils.

The heaviness didn't get to a distracting level of pain, and I had my
second meal without incident a litle after 6 PM.

## Next day (2024-07-19)

On 2024-07-19, things were fine in the morning. I still went out
jogging and jogged a good amount (about 1.7 miles, 0.3 miles return
walk). I experienced some abdominal pain later in the afternoon. It
was less than on 2024-07-18, but there was also more heat-related
fatigue and disorientation, so on net I may have felt worse. With that
said, my productivity/output seemed pretty good, and I executed on
both physical and mental work.

## Two days later (2024-07-20)

On this day, I had to go shopping, so I skipped jogging in the morning
to avoid the fiasco of 2024-07-18.

I did breath holds in the morning before going shopping, and perhaps
because of that, felt a little out-of-breath initially when
walking. However, I was back to normal later in the journey.

When I got back, I took a pulse oximeter reading, getting 55-67 bpm
with the typical range being 59-64 bpm.

## Three days later (2024-07-21)

This day I again pulled something vaguely similar to 2024-07-18: I
went jogging, then did strength exercises, then shortly after that I
went shopping.

However, the jogging was a little less extreme (about 1.5 miles
jogging / 0.5 miles walking), I rested a few minutes before going out,
and my outside trip was not as far off. So, I did not have the same
degree of fatigue-causing stimuli.

However, I had [finger injuries](2024-07-21-finger-injuries.md) that
caused me some physical and mental stress. Also, due to these, I was
trying to space out my urination (to give the finger injury time to
heal). These factors may have been responsible for an increase in
abdominal discomfort toward the later afternoon, and a reduced
appetite for my second meal of the day. There was a brief period where
I was feeling particularly crappy, though it didn't last too long.

## Four days later (2024-07-22)

On 2024-07-22, I was mostly fine but did experience slight discomfort
off and on, and more pronounced discomfort a few times.

## Five days later (2024-07-23)

On 2024-07-23, I again experienced slight discomfort and it was a
little more acute later in the day.

## Six days later (2024-07-24)

Factor X applied.

Going to sleep on the night of 2024-07-23, I had been thinking of
skipping exercise on 2024-07-24 to give myself more room for a fuller
recovery. I ended up doing this on the morning of 2024-07-24. I also
stayed in bed a little longer than my natural inclination, to get the
benefits of more sleep.

Already on the morning of 2024-07-24, I was feeling a little more
pronounced and frequent discomfort than the past two days. This
continued low-key through the day. I don't know if this was due to the
deliberate decision to have a slow day and not go out, and don't know
if this represents a worsening or is the recovery process in action.

## Seven days later (2024-07-25)

Having gone to sleep early the previous night (2024-07-24), I stayed
in bed a little longer, so that I got over 8.5 hours in bed.

I did all my usual exercises, including jogging and strength exercises.

I did notice what felt like excess stomach acid (as evidenced by
burping and a little bit of flatulence), but it wasn't
super-pronounced, and it only got a little more pronounced due to
delays with eating. It was fine after eating and didn't get in the way
of my mood for most of the day.

## Eight days later (2024-07-26)

I was feeling worse on this day (between my first and second meal)
than the previous day. I narrowed down two causes of the difference:

* I had gotten more sleep overnight on the previous day.

* I consumed vegan probiotic yogurt in the first meal on the previous
  day, and didn't consume it in the first meal on this day.

I remedied the second factor by consuming vegan probiotic yogurt in
the second meal, and I did feel relatively better (almost as well as
the previous day) in the period between the second meal and going to
sleep.

## Nine days later (2024-07-27)

I followed the identified best practices and was feeling generally
good through the day, though my total accounted-for hours were a bit
low.

## Ten days later (2024-07-28)

Despite trying to follow best practices, I didn't feel as good as the
previous day, though still better than two days and four days
ago. There were a few specific things that happened today:

* Maybe slight rushing of morning bowel movement due to a timer going
  off that I needed to turn off (though I did feel like I finished up).

* Potatoes/peas prep and more consumption of that (my mixed veggies
  were over).

* A decent amount of cleaning activity after meal, and in general a
  lot of physical moving around activity; ironically I felt fine
  during the activity but settling down right after it I experienced
  more discomfort.

* The fragmented nature of the day meant I did not get deep
  intellectual engagement which tends to drive out thoughts of the
  discomfort.

I did notice that my discomfort would peak right before urination and
I'd feel pretty normal after urination. This has been an observation
in the past as well, but was particularly pronounced today.

## Eleven days later (2024-07-29)

I felt mostly good through the day, with occasional abdominal
discomfort right at the peak of urine buildups.

## Twelve days later (2024-07-30)

I continued to feel good through most of the day; in fact, this was
probably my best day in a while. However, I did continue to experience
similar symptoms as before. Late in the day, I experienced more pain
than usual, but urination helped reduce the pain.

## Thirteen days later (2024-07-31)

Factor X applied.

I was feeling more pain than usual this morning. Considering that this
was also the case the last time factor X had applied (2024-07-24) I
now suspect factor X to be an aggravator.

I did two unusual things later in the day:

* I started a break from sauerkraut. I'm planning to sustain this
  break for a week and then reassess.

* I decided to try a bowel movement in the afternoon at around 3
  PM. Surprisingly, a bowel movement happened without effort on my
  part (even though I didn't feel a strong urge for one). This
  suggests to me that perhaps the issue is incomplete bowel movements
  in the morning, despite feeling satisfied shortly after the bowel
  movement. But it's unclear if today was unusual. I'm planning to try
  a bowel movement a few more times in the future.

  I did notice a little bleeding when wiping after the bowel movement,
  but it didn't seem too concerning. I didn't experience any
  pain. I'll keep an eye out for bleeding in the future, and make sure
  that for any low-pressure bowel movements I don't try to push stuff
  out forcefully which might make bleeding worse.

I felt relieved after the bowel movement though not "perfectly fine"
so I don't think this alone did the trick. I continued to be approximately in this good state till my next meal and then for a couple of hours afterward; however, I had more pronounced sensations of discomfort around 9 PM as I settled into sedentary work. The sensations continued till before I went to sleep, though there were times in between where it didn't feel unpleasant at all.
