## Executive summary

NOTE: This executive summary was written around 2024-08-15 /
2024-08-16 and has not been updated to reflect more recent
developments, including the FoodMarble Aire 2 purchase decision and
readings. Access the readings
[here](../../sql/foodmarble_aire_2_breath_tests.sql). See the
[Subsequent days](#subsequent-days) section for more recent
developments.

On 2024-07-18, I overexerted myself (running 1.7 miles then walking
3.3 miles with only small breaks in between) and delayed eating. In
the immediately preceding days, I had eaten lentils at a relatively
high rate (starting 2024-07-14). I ate freshly prepped peas in the
delayed meal after returning on 2024-07-18.

A combination of these factors seems to have triggered abdominal
discomfort in me. Unlike the [2024-04-25 onward
incident](2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md), there was no acute increase
in pain that panicked me, nor was there a situation of clear-cut
constipation. However, the symptoms were qualitatively somewhat
similar to the less acute portion of the symptoms last time, so I
suspect a similar underlying set of causes but different triggers.

My overall symptoms from 2024-07-18 to 2024-08-15 (four weeks) or so
have been generally mild, and I have, for the most part, been able to
carry on with my work, personal chores, and exercise as usual (though
for some portions of the period I have deliberately skipped exercise
to see how much it helps, for the most part I haven't felt I "needed"
to skip exercise). The period has been one of otherwise low stress and
high flexibility, which means that stress has not contributed to
exacerbating any issues.

My symptoms have shifted a bit: while abdominal pain / discomfort have
been a common thread, the initial symptoms seemed to include more
reflux (and more susceptibility to mouth injuries), the first 3 weeks
were characterized by clearly greater burping and flatulence than
usual, and there have been some off-and-on signs of mild constipation
(though I have consistently had regular daily morning bowel movements
that cover most of my bowel evacuation needs). I suspect some of the
foods I stopped have helped with the flatulence reduction: lentils,
peas, sauerkraut (though I'm less sure how much this helped), and
broccoli (stopped at the end of the period so its effects are not seen
in the time period). Stomach rumble has generally gone down along with
flatulence and burping, and the locus of the pain has shifted to being
more clearly below the belly button.

Based on possibilities I have come across online, the best fit seems
to be some form of intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO), formerly
known as methane-dominant SIBO. IMO is one of the likely main causes
of what's called IBS-C (irritable bowel syndrome, constipation
type). While my symptoms do not meet all the criteria to be classified
as IBS-C, they do seem to be generally in that direction compared to
my normal steady state. My current plan is to follow the low-hanging
fruit advice conditional to IMO (that would be no-regret even if I had
a different condition) and monitor for a couple more weeks before
escalating to other options such as testing. I also plan to continue
to investigate other possibilities and see if there are easy tests or
no-regret advice I can follow for those.

## Open questions

* Do I continue to abstain from all these foods until I feel a lot
  better and/or get a clearer diagnosis? Or do I try some of them to
  see if they worsen symptoms?

  Foods in question: sauerkraut, lentils, peas, broccoli

* How should I think about exercise? My plan right now is to basically
  resume exercise if I feel like it.

* Should I get more blood tests done that are relatively low-cost and
  don't require a prescription, even if they are unlikely to flag
  anything? For instance, a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and
  complete blood count (CBC). I got both of these in April as part of
  the urgent care visit.

* Should I get some longer-term blood tests done that I had been
  planning to do around this time, or wait till I feel better? For
  instance, lipid profile, insulin, HbA1c, Vitamin D3 and B12,
  omega-3.

* Any other blood tests to do?

* Should I get the not-very-reliable FoodMarble Aire 2 for $249 to get
  a general sense of things? This can be used to get a large number of
  readings, and it does not require a doctor's order, but its
  reliability is supposedly less than the TrioSmart breath test.

* Should I, when should I, and how should I get the TrioSmart breath
  test to see if I actually have IMO? The "how" part is basically
  trying to figure out how to get a doctor's order for the test.

## General evolution

* Symptoms of reflux have gone down over time (burping, susceptibility
  to getting / long recovery time from mouth injuries).

* Flatulence seems to have dropped around the week of
  2024-08-12. Burping and stomach rumble also seem to have dropped
  further around the same time.

* The locus of the pain seems to have shifted and is clearly below the
  belly button as of 2024-08-12. Peak intensity of pain also seems to
  have increased and it has shifted in character from bloating to
  cramping.

* Frequency of good days may have increased over time, but on the
  other hand acuteness of pain may also have increased.

## Summary of symptoms and experience so far

Summary last updated 2024-08-15, at around 4 weeks later.

Overall, this is a case of intermittent abdominal pain, along with
other symptoms.

### Pain symptoms

Pain is very subjective, so it is hard to chalk its trajectory over
the course of 4 weeks. However, these are my overall impressions:

* Generally speaking, the pain has been intermittent, ranging from a 0
  to a 2 out of 10. Even when it is absent, I still feel some unusual
  sense in the area when I probe it.

* The initial pain was more diffuse and not very acute.

* Around the week of 2024-08-12, the pain had shifted to being more
  cramp-like and limited to below the belly button, i.e., lower
  abdominal pain, and having more brief acute manifestations. It is
  almost always in the middle, with very occasional shifting to the
  right. I also experienced a bit more pelvic pain (usually on the
  right side pelvis) though that pain was well within normal bounds
  (where I would not even bother to investigate it if it occurred on
  its own).

### Pain symptoms that I did not have

I did **not** have any of these:

* Visible bloating (aka abdominal distension, sometimes called "food
  babies"): I have regularly checked for visible bloating after eating
  and at other times, and have not seen it ever.

* Significant increase in pain on palpation: When pressing different
  areas of the abdomen, including the areas where I was subjectively
  feeling pain, I did not notice an increase in pain except a very
  slight increase at significant pressing. There was no sharp increase
  in pain. When I did this in front of a mirror, I never saw
  involuntary gasps of pain.

* Rebound tenderness: Similar to the above, I did not notice any sharp
  pain when releasing after palpation.

* Hardness: My abdomen felt comparably soft to the usual.

* Guarding: I did not have any reflex against self-palpation, even
  when I did so at times that the pain was highest.

### Things that help with pain relief (timing-wise)

* For the most part (excluding occasional spikes of pain) pain seems
  to reach a maximum right before urination and is then at a minimum
  about five minutes after urination. However, the act of urination
  itself doesn't seem to cause or relieve pain. I suspect that a
  fuller bladder just adds to the overall discomfort rather than being
  the primary cause. The net effect of this is that I urinated more
  frequently but a similar total volume, so a little less per cycle.

* Pain generally is less noticeable when eating, though there doesn't
  seem a very clear pattern on what it is like before and after
  eating.

* I did not get consistent patterns regarding the relationship with
  time of day etc.

### Non-pain "tangible" symptoms that were present

* More burping than usual: The burping seemed to reduce quite
  a bit toward the later period, around 2024-08-12.

* Occasional flatulence, generally very small amounts: The
  flatulence did not have a particularly bad smell. The level of
  flatulence also dropped around the week of 2024-08-12.

* Audible abdominal activity in some mornings: This again
  dropped quite a bit around the week of 2024-08-12.

* For the first two weeks or so, off-and-on symptoms of some reflux,
  such as slight throat soreness, slower healing time from / greater
  propensity for mouth injuries.

### Other semi-tangible symptoms

I have occasionally, during high heat when I sweat a lot, sensed an
"onion smell" / "peas smell". This doesn't necessarily correlate with
the pain itself (the smell may have been more pronounced on my best
days, though I'm not too sure). As it's difficult to be sure of
smells, I don't count this quite as a tangible thing. But it might be
suggestive of particular theories, as discussed later.

### Wellness fluctuation over time

A few days stand out as being particularly good:

* 2024-08-03 (Saturday): This was the day after I went out to Kitava
  for a meal with friends. This was the culmination of a three-day
  improvement starting with the lows of 2024-07-31. It's puzzliing
  because:

  * I did a lot of unwise/risky things before it (on 2024-08-02),
    including going out and eating, and sleeping fewer hours than
    usual.

  * I suspect that my bad state of the next few days (2024-08-04 to
    2024-08-06) was related to the stuff I had done before and during
    this day, specifically the meal I had outside. But this day itself went well.

  * This was only the start of my stopping peas, which seemed to
    relate with symptoms, but things got worse immediately after this.

* 2024-08-07 (Wednesday): This was one of my best days. It seemed like
  I had finally recovered from the side-effects of the outside
  meal. But the good times didn't last, because on 2024-08-08, things
  took a turn for the worse, partly related to me trying out lentils
  consumption (my thinking being that as I've stopped peas, I should
  try lentils to get the protein).

* 2024-08-14 (Wednesday): Okay, this day wasn't *that* good in terms
  of some aspects of my subjective experience, but I seem to have had
  a lot of energy and did a lot of things. And I had a 4.5-hour long
  conversation where I mostly forgot about the thing, and I didn't get
  any immediate comeuppance right after it.

For the first two examples above in particular, I do not know to what
extent these represented genuine recovery that I then undid with other
actions.

Here are a few other patterns of interest:

* For the first two weeks, I had semi-consistent zigzag patterns of
  better versus worse days. As I have some activities that I do every
  alternate day, I tried to see what might correlate. One thing I
  noticed was that the better day was the one where I did strength
  exercises. But, the causality could be that strength exercises make
  me feel better, or it could be that strength exercises make me feel
  worse, with a one-day lag. The later two weeks did not have such a
  consistent pattern.

### Relationship with food consumption

I did not get clear evidence on the relationship with food
consumption.

* I paused sauerkraut consumption on 2024-07-31, partly also because
  of mouth injuries that it might exacerbate. I somehow intuitively
  felt that that helped, but I don't have clear evidence for
  this. There's no clear before-after impact.

* I suspect that the consumption of onions as part of my outside food
  meal at Kitava (meeting friends) on 2024-08-02 caused increased
  flatulence from 2024-08-04 to 2024-08-06 or so.

* I paused peas consumption after 2024-08-03, out of a suspicion that
  peas were causing some of the flatulence symptoms. The flatulence
  part did go down after that (making a brief return with the attempt
  to have lentils) so this might have worked. But, I was seeing
  overall improvements from 2024-07-31 to 2024-08-03 before I stopped
  peas, and the picture reversed after that. So it's not clear if
  stopping peas was good overall.

* I tried lentils on 2024-08-08, but intuited that I didn't react well
  to them (and there was increased flatulence) so after the first day
  of trying them I paused them. The previous day (2024-08-07) had been
  great, and after trying lentils I couldn't maintain that greatness,
  and lentils seem like the obvious culprit, but perhaps the previous
  day was an anomaly. I also suspect that preparation factors, such as
  not draining all the soaking water, may have exacerbated my reaction
  to lentils.

  Also, I had consumed a lot of lentil in the few days shortly before
  the abdominal pain started (this was not super-salient to me back
  when the pain started, but it became clearer when I reviewed my food
  consumption retrospectively).

* I'm planning to pause broccoli consumption for a little while after
  2024-08-15 (as I finish this batch of it).

* For unrelated reasons (unplanned fasting) I paused walnut
  consumption for two days (2024-08-14 and 2024-08-15). The duration
  is too short to see any clear impact.

### Bowel movement cycle

I maintained regular bowel movements in the morning for the entire
4-week period. I did not notice any clear changes to stool quality or
quantity over the period.

However, I did have some slight irregularities, that are way more than
I usually have:

* I attempted additional bowel movements at least a few times over the
  period, and had small-sized bowel movements with otherwise normal
  characteristics in many of the cases. In no case did I have a strong
  urge for bowel movement; the motivation in all these cases was the
  suspicion that bowel clearing would reduce my pain and discomfort:

  * 2024-07-31: Successful second bowel movement at around 3 PM

  * 2024-08-04: Unsuccessful second bowel movement attempt at around 6:30 PM

  * 2024-08-08: Successful second bowel movement between first and
    second meal

  * 2024-08-13: Successful second bowel movement before much-delayed
    first meal

  * 2024-08-15: Successful but very small second bowel movement about
    an hour after first meal

  The evidence seems consistent with the idea that bowel clearing
  helped mostly just by getting rid of an added source of pressure
  that was exacerbating my discomfort (similar to the effect that
  urination seems to have), rather than an overfull bowel per se being
  a cause of the discomfort.

* Occasionally over the period, and somewhat more consistently toward
  the later part (around 2024-08-12) I experienced symptoms in the
  direction of constipation:

  * My morning urge for a bowel movement was a little less than it has
    historically been. However, it was still strong enough for me to
    have a significant bowel movement that accounted for most of moy
    bowel movement cycle.

  * I had a bit more of a sense of tenesmus than usual -- a sense of
    incomplete evacuation. With that said, for the most part I felt
    satisfied at the end of each morning bowel movement cycle. Still,
    it wasn't as complete a sense of satisfaction as I am used to
    historically.

### Relationship with posture (lying down, sitting, standing, walking)

In general, I probably experience more pain when sitting, but it's not
clear to me how much of that is just a result of spending more time
sitting. I don't know if the proportion of my time sitting where I
have pain is higher. But that might indeed be the case.

Anecdotally, I have noticed an increase in pain sometimes when going
from standing / gently moving around (e.g., washing dishes) to
sitting. I've rarely noticed an increase the other way around (getting
up from sitting).

While I haven't experienced an increase in pain lying down, this might
be partly because I go lie down at night after having a bath which
might have a relaxing effect.

### Relationship with exercise

For the most part, I did not see a clear relationship with exercise,
though I did make sure to not go all the way to max out on exercise,
given that overexercise is a likely trigger for the beginning of it.

* Subjectively, jogging seems to have helped reduce GI tract activity
  and reduce the sense of discomfort.

* Strength exercise days appear to have been somewhat better overall.

* I did try not exercising on 2024-07-31 and that day was worse than
  usual, but I later correlated this to another factor.

* I skipped exercise on days I had morning shopping trips, and these
  days were roughly similar to the exercise days.

* In some cases, breath holds made me feel worse but the effects
  generally did not seem to last longer than 10 minutes.

* I did another attempt at skipping exercises on 2024-08-14 and
  2024-08-15. 2024-08-14 was a high-energy day (likely due to energy
  conserved from skipping exercises), but not super-clearly great as
  far as abdominal discomfort is concerned.

### Relationship with stress

Overall, the entire period was one of low cognitive and emotional
stress, though I did have minor finger injuries on 2024-07-21 that,
although not too bad, did contribute to stress.

Ironically, periods within these 4 weeks where I felt better were
periods of greater stress in some sense as I tackled more cognitively
and emotionally challenging tasks, but I would characterize that
stress as eustress and not distress.

A few more specifics related to stress:

* This was a period where my deliverables at work were few, which
  allowed me to vary my work hours based on other needs and reduced
  the impact my pain had on my work delivery.

* I didn't have a lot of synchronous meetings with work colleagues,
  and the ones I did have were fairly pleasant and informal. I didn't
  have any stress around needing to be in a meeting at a specific time
  that was inconvenient. I only very occasionally had brief stress
  around needing to be attentive and engaged in a meeting while
  feeling a level of pain that made it harder than usual. This is less
  than the local stress I've felt in the past from being in meetings
  while feeling fatigued, having other things on my mind, or having a
  sore throat.

* This was a period where I was able to make significant progress on a
  number of things in personal projects as well as wrap up
  administrative tasks that had been pending for a while. Presumably
  this happened a little slower than it otherwise would, but I felt
  very good about it.

I did feel a little bit of stress/sadness as the issue continued for
four weeks, but for the most part I've channeled this constructively
and haven't gone into loops of anxiety and self-talk.

My takeaways:

* The causal arrow from cognitive or emotional stress to these issues
  is very unlikely (with the potential exception of temporary increase
  in pain on 2024-07-21 after finger injuries, where it was a
  combination of physical, cognitive, and emotional stress).

* With that said, I think the potential for cognitive or emotional
  stress to exacerbate the symptoms is a possibility in my head and
  has led me in this period to generally not take up optional things
  that might cause stress. For comparison, for the acute incident on
  2024-04-25 (three months ago) where I had severe abdominal pain, I
  think cognitive and emotional stress may have played some role even
  if I wasn't "feeling the stress" very explicitly. There was nothing
  like that in this period.

* The reverse arrow -- these issues contributing to cognitive or
  emotional stress -- has a bit of truth to it, but other factors
  pushed my cognitive and emotional stress in the opposite direction
  and the net effect on my cognitive and emotional stress seems to be
  positive relative to the past few months. Definitely relative to a
  year ago or two years ago!



### Vitals

I have two days (2024-07-13 and 2024-07-17) of recorded pulse oximeter
readings (see [here](../../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql)) from
before the start of this issue, and several days (about 8 as of
2024-08-15) of recorded readings from after the start of the
issue. Overall, it seems like my heart rate has gone up a little bit
(from about 41-52 bpm to about 51-62 bpm under comparable conditions),
but the differences may be explained by factors such as temperature
changes. Even the increased rate is still at the bradycardic edge.

I have several days of blood pressure readings (see
[here](../../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql)) from before the start
of this issue, and two days from after the start of the issue. The
heart rate portion of the observations is roughly consistent with what
I saw with the pulse oximeter, though the smaller number of
observations makes that part less valuable than the pulse
oximeter. The blood pressure readings are roughly similar to what they
were before.

### Sleep patterns and relationship between sleep and pain

I've been trying to follow the practice of getting into bed about 8.5
hours before my expected waking-up time. However, I have not always
been able to achieve this.

I have also tried to follow a practice of deliberately sleeping in
after I initially wake up to urinate. However, over time, I've been
waking up earlier to urinate (compared to my natural waking-up time)
so that the net effect on my waking-up time has not been to delay it
by much.

Overall, I have been able to stay above 7 hours of sleep each time,
above 7 hours 40 minutes on most days, and above 8 hours on at least
half of the days. In all cases, the constraint preventing me from
sleeping more was not that I needed to be up for something specific,
but that I just didn't feel like sleeping. Often but not always this
was related to bowel pressure being high enough that staying asleep
wasn't comfortable.

My average sleep amount is probably about 30-45 minutes more per day
than it is when I am feeling well, and this is partly due to
deliberate efforts on my part to sleep in a bit more and partly
because my body does need a bit more sleep. The general mix of
motivations for getting out of bed is pretty similar to what it used
to be.

Overall, I have weak anecdotal evidence that sleeping at the low end
of the range can cause more pain, but on the other hand one of my best
days (2024-08-03) was after just 7 hours of sleep, so I'm not too
sure.

ADDED 2024-08-16: As I've been learning more about intestinal
methanogen overgrowth (IMO) and its implications for slower motility,
I wonder if I have been going about the sleep stuff wrong. I've been
prioritizing getting sufficient sleep, but perhaps the higher priority
should have been given to getting a long enough gap between eating and
sleeping. So far, I've kept a gap of at least 3 hours between eating
and sleeping, but based on [this video
slide](https://youtu.be/e66fEUGVCzE?t=1116) for instance, I should
actually be aiming for at least 4 hours gap between finishing my meal
and sleeping. Obviously it is best to have both, but where in doubt, I
think erring on the side of maintaining a higher eating/sleeping gap
at the risk of sleeping a bit late is probably better. I might do a
historical analysis of eating and sleeping times (I don't have a
systematic log of these, but can infer them from computer usage logs)
to see if there is a historical correlation.

### Relationship with temperature

It looks like heat can exacerbate my overall sense of discomfort, and
make me notice the pain a bit more. I haven't seen clear evidence that
heat (within the range I am exposed to) meaningfully affects the
amount of pain.

### Productivity impact

These are some of the effects on productivity:

* Reduced hours of availability due to longer sleep time reduced my
  output a little bit, but the effect size here wasn't huge. If I were
  feeling totally well conditional to sleeping this little bit more, I
  would not be complaining.

* A bigger effect on my productivity came from the imposed regularity
  on my sleep time preventing me from picking things up in the evening
  that might end up hooking me and leading me to stay late. So here
  it's not so much the number of hours of sleep but the reduced
  flexibility in how to allocate those hours that affected my
  productivity.

* The pain may have also more directly affected my ability and
  willigness to pick up some more complex open-ended tasks, given
  challenges with concentrating on them. Fortunately I still have a
  lot of relatively more routine tasks where the pain doesn't affect
  my productivity much.

* I think periods of higher pain were also periods when my
  generativity and ideation levels were lower, even holding the task
  constant.

### Mood impact

Since mood is more subjective and harder to grasp, it's a bit more
challenging to compare my mood between now and a month ago. In this
respect, the few good days I had in between were helpful because my
mood memories were close enough that I felt I could reliably compare
them and take a comparative picture.

My general sense is that even though the productivity impact was not
too huge, the mood impact was huge. On the days that were particularly
good, I felt very excited about everything, even the most mundane
things. On the days that were merely good or slightly bad, though, I
just didn't have that level of overarching excitement, even though I
did feel more local sense of excitement.

For the period 2024-08-12 onward, when the nature of the pain turned
more to something of the cramping flavor, I noticed something I had
noticed in my last round of abdominal pain (starting 2024-04-25) --
getting excited about something very quickly would increase my
pain. This in turn made me more cautious mood-wise.

## Comparison with the previous round starting 2024-04-25

Reference document for the previous round: [2024-04-25 abdominal
pain](2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md).

### Key difference of acute incident

The previous round started with a very acute incident, where I'd rate
my pain intensity as something like a 7 out of 10. More details are in
that document. The incident was acute enough that I considered rushing
to urgent care, though I ultimately deferred the urgent care visit by
a few days.

With this round, I had no comparable acute incident.

### Similarities and differences in symptom pattern

Symptom or symptom aspect | Previous round | Current round
-- | -- | --
How long the pain lasted | 1 acute day, seemingly some symptoms continued for about a week and then sporadically for the next few weeks | Seemingly going on for at least four weeks
Pain location | Started out clearly below the belly button, then seemingly moved above the belly button four days later, with a lot of shifting and diffuse nature | Started out diffuse, around 2024-08-12 became more specific to below the belly button with occasional shifts to the right
Pain characteristics | Bloating-like feel (but no abdominal distension) though I don't quite know how accurate my past terminology is | Initially bloating-like feel, later cramping
Pain intensity | High for a brief period (7 out of 10), 0 to 2 for a few days in the next week, then sporadic (not clearly recorded) | 0 to 2 for most of the duration, peak intensity may have been 3 briefly
Constipation | Clear constipation on first day (day of acute incident), slight constipation on next day, seemingly normal bowel movements after that | No clear constipation -- normal morning bowel movements every day -- but cases of second bowel movements on some days with the (validated) hope that this would reduce my pain
Diarrhea | No observed diarrhea | No observed diarrhea
Flatulence | No recorded increase in flatulence | Increase in flatulence for the first 2-3 weeks
Burping/reflux | No recorded increase in burping/reflux | Increase in burping/reflux for the first 2 weeks or so
Suspected food triggers that I stopped | Whole wheat lavash (relatively clear evidence); some other things that I have too rarely for clear data patterns | Lentils (strongest evidence but still weaker than wheat), peas, sauerkraut, and broccoli

Roughly speaking, there's more overlap between the observed symptoms
2024-08-12 onward this time and the previous set of symptoms, with the
cramping/bloating distinction.

### Strategic differences: exercises versus food

One thing I did differently last time was that I took an extended
break from exercise. One plausible story is that this long break from
exercise is what allowed me to recover more quickly last time. On the
other hand, I feel like the differences are more a reflection of how
my body was feeling rather than my conscious cognitive strategy --
last time, I didn't *feel* like exercising, and this time, I did
(until about 2024-08-12 when the symptoms switched to a more
cramping-like nature, and I did pause exercise at that time as it
didn't feel right for my body).

The other big difference this time is that I stopped more foods (last
time I just stopped wheat; this time I did peas, sauerkraut, lentils,
and broccoli). But this is more a function of the fact that stopping
the first thing didn't stop my problem, so I stopped another, and then
another. Whereas last time, stopping wheat seemed to have a clear
benefit (and trying to have it again seemed to return some of the
symptoms), the effect of stopping individual foods this time was less
clear-cut, with the potential exception of lentils.

### Differences in background stress

The acute start on 2024-04-25 of the previous round was accompanied by
one highly unusual stress factor and two moderately unusual stress
factors. In contrast, for the current round, my background stress was
lower. Perhaps that's the reason I did not have an acute incident in
this round (at least for the first 4 weeks).

## Theories of causes and exacerbating factors

### Potential triggers: things that were happening shortly before the abdominal pain

#### Likely immediate cause: overexertion

Chronology suggests that overexertion was the likely immediate
cause. The TL;DR is that I ran 1.7 miles and walked another 3.3 miles
(approximately) all before eating anything, and I delayed eating for
quite a bit, and was also in a call while eating.

The problem is that I can't find a clear mechanism for how
overexertion at this level can create lasting damage.

So it's possible that this was the trigger that made me susceptible to
something else that was the actual cause. More in the theories
section.

#### Lentils consumption

I prepped lentils on 2024-07-13 / 2024-07-14 and started eating them
on 2024-07-14. I don't have a clear record of when I finished them,
but I think they were either fully finished, or close to it, by
2024-07-18. I had noticed a bit of intermittent discomfort / flatuence
from lentils in general, but it was not different from usual.

#### Peas consumption on 2024-07-18

I didn't have a lot of peas on 2024-07-18, but might have had more
than I should have, considering the significant overexertion.

#### Lemon use over the past few days

I had been using up a lemon starting 2024-06-16 in small quantities,
and put the lemon in my lentils on 2024-07-14. It could be that the
combination of lemon and lentils somehow caused an issue. I didn't
immediately throw the lemon piece away on 2024-07-18, instead just
transferring it to the next food and then the food after that, and
getting some lemon juice from it without directly consuming the lemon
piece itself.

### Background factors / potential root causes

#### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) / intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO) etc.

Take a look at the [most recent
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMXV16065hA) with the latest
SIBO/IMO jargon. Use it as reference. [This time
point](https://youtu.be/HMXV16065hA?t=2247) is particularly relevant
for my summary below.

Here's my quick summary of the jargon (fka means "formerly known as"):

* Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), fka hydrogen-dominant
  SIBO: Lots of hydrogen-producing bacteria, mainly escherichia coli
  (e. coli) and klebsiella, in the small intestine.

  SIBO correlates with diarrhea, and is believed to be a big
  proportion of IBS-D.

  One seemingly primary cause of SIBO is food poisoning that includes
  CdTB, leading the body to produce an antibody that also attacks
  vinculin, a key protein that protects the intestinal lining, and
  this makes people susceptible to SIBO. So in short: food poisoning
  with CdTB -> antibody against vinculin -> reduction in vinculin ->
  more susceptibility.

  There also seem to be autoimmune conditions that can lead to SIBO
  without going through the food poisoning route (for instance,
  [Sjogren's](https://www.sjogrensadvocate.com/post/gastrointestinal-manifestations). I
  don't have any evidence that I have any of these autoimmune
  conditions.

* Intestinal sulfide overproduction (ISO), fka H2S-dominant SIBO: Lots
  of sulfide-producing bacteria.

  Like SIBO, ISO is correlated with diarrhea, and is believed to be a
  big proportion of IBS-D. It often co-occurs with SIBO (with
  essentially the SIBO-produced hydrogen acting as input for the ISO
  bacteria).

  The mechanism for ISO also seems to be the same as for SIBO (but
  with SIBO being an additional intermediary): food poisoning with
  CdTB -> antibody against vinculin -> reduction in vinculin -> more
  susceptibility.

* Intestinal methanogen overgrowth (IMO), fka methane-dominant SIBO:
  Lots of methane-producing organisms, aka methanogens. Methanogens
  aren't even bacteria, they are archaea. Unlike SIBO, the methanogens
  are found in both the small and large intestine.

  NOTE: Some hydrogen-producing bacteria are needed to create the
  conditions for methanogens. But, the level of hydrogen-producing
  bacteria may not be high enough to be in the SIBO range, or the
  hydrogen-producing bacteria may just be in the large intestine (in
  which case it wouldn't be SIBO) while the methanogens could still
  potentially move into the small intestine.

  It doesn't look like there is a lot of clarity on the cause of
  IMO. One route is SIBO leading to IMO, with food poisoning leading
  to SIBO, but this isn't the dominant path. See
  [here](https://youtu.be/J-sgU-CCNrc?t=410) for a claimed list of
  causes.

  It also seems unclear to me if IMO can be strictly limited to the
  large bowel (LIMO?) or strictly limited to the small bowel (SIMO?)
  or if it always spreads out across both. This is relevant to me
  because perhaps my symptoms fit only LIMO and not SIMO. My
  understanding is that if it's only LIMO, the impact on motility,
  digestion, and absorption will be much more limited, and that is
  more consistent with my symptoms so far.

Which of these if any do I have?

* SIBO / ISO is unlikely because I haven't had a food poisoning event
  of the sort that is described as a precursor to these, nor do I (to
  my knowledge) have any of the rare conditions that could be
  alternate pathways to SIBO / ISO.

* IMO is still plausible because, at least judging from recent
  developments, I do seem to be trending in the direction of
  constipation, though I am very far from the clinical definition of
  constipation. Also, some of the other data is consistent with
  IMO. The onion smell, that would suggest ISO, is possible because
  there is some increase in H2S bacteria in some IMO cases.

  In fact, IMO does seem like the most likely single possibility of
  all the ones I have listed.

* I think the main thing that makes me skeptical of the IMO diagnosis
  is that my overall symptoms don't quite match up in severity and
  quality with what I could gather are the symptoms of people who post
  about it. But, this could just reflect the fact that most people
  take a very long time to get to the diagnosis, often cycling through
  lots of doctors and blood tests, and because they are not focused on
  the right set of steps, their symptoms get worse over the time
  period. There's also a selection effect where only people whose
  symptoms exceed some degree of severity are likely to seek treatment
  and/or post about it on Reddit, YouTube, etc.

A few more notes specific to IMO and trying to fit it in with my case:x

* IMO is characterized by slow motility, and the general advice for it
  is to eat fewer meals (which I already do), have at least 4 hours
  gap between meal (which I do most of the time), and have at least 4
  hours gap between eating and sleep (compared to normal guidance of
  at least 3 hours gap). See [this video
  slide](https://youtu.be/e66fEUGVCzE?t=1116) for more information. I
  haven't seen clear evidence of slow motility, but I can try to
  increase the gap from eating to sleeping and make sure it's at least
  4 hours. As of now I do at least 3 hours, and often it's more -- so
  it may be worth seeing if the lag between eating and sleeping on one
  evening has historically correlated with my quality of life the next
  day.

* Sources on IMO such as
  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKYyassLhyo) highlight the
  importance of full bowel evacuation as a first step to relief. In my
  case, I feel like I mostly get to this, so if I do have IMO then
  this could be a reason it's not as severe as that of many
  people. With that said, this also highlights the importance of
  doubling down on the eating-sleeping gap.

* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e66fEUGVCzE) provides
  more of a theoretical background on IMO. One interesting thing it
  says is that the appendix is a reservoir of methanogens (see also
  [this
  paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972888/)). I do
  wonder if that might explain why my cramping pain has occasionally
  shifted to my lower right side (around the pelvic area or above)
  even though those movements have been brief.

* The shift in character of pain around 2024-08-12 could be consistent
  with "die-off" reactions
  cf. [this](https://gutpowerdrinks.com/blogs/blog/sibo-die-off-symptoms)
  but the fact that the pain has continued for almost five days now
  doesn't fit super-well with the idea of die-off. But it's possible
  that the methanogens are being somewhat starved and are fighting the
  process, causing the more localized pain around their source area
  (the appendix) while still not fully dying off. Monitoring for more
  days while staying off of peas, lentils, etc. seems like a way to
  find out.

To test, I could do:

* The $349 TrioSmart breath test, which is doctor-ordered so I'll need
  a doctor to order it, so the effective cost would be much higher
  (even more so because most doctors will want to make their own
  judgment so the first doctor I try may not be willing to prescribe
  the test for me) (and there would also be additional time needed).

* The $249 FoodMarble Aire device, which seems to be way less reliable
  but can give multiple real-time readings and doesn't need a doctor's
  order.

There is no easy treat-to-test option, but a few possibilities:

* The antibiotics to treat (rifaximin + others based on the type of
  SIBO/IMO) require prescription and the prescription in turn reqires
  the TrioSmart breath test. Antibiotics in any case should not just
  be tried as a treat-to-test given the complication. So this is not
  an option that can be tried out before a test.

* Artichoke has cured the motility issues with people's SIBO/IMO; see for
  instance
  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/wcuxyz/made_a_video_about_my_sibo_experience_and_full/).

#### Butyrate depletion?

See
[this](https://www.lucymailing.com/the-oxygen-gut-dysbiosis-connection/)
for instance. It says how there's a positive feedback loop (in a bad
way) where facultative anaerobes, many of them pathogenic, can take
over the large intestine as butyrate production falls, and lactate and
oxygen rise. See also
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CBlVFLXuIE).

Research on the exercise-butyrate connection is recent and
preliminary, but there do seem indications that moderate exercise
helps and heavy exercise hurts butyrate. I think lactate buildup is
one theoretical explanation.

Butyrate depletion theory seems to make sense in these ways:

* As a thin person, I probably have fewer body reserves of butyrate,
  so potentially I might be more susceptible?

* It can tie in with overexertion.

* It is local to the large intestine which feels more consistent with
  my symptoms.

It can be tested as follows:

* Stool test from some of the more niche testing companies include
  butyrate.

There are treat-to-test options that might be easier in terms of cost
and time than getting a test, though I have to be careful of the
risks:

* Butyrate supplements are available off of Amazon.

* Akkermansia is a probiotic that helps build back butyrate; this is
  available from various third-party sellers off of Amazon; see
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok5Xxo4ho7A) for instance.

#### Glutamine depletion?

Glutamine could be another thing as it helps with muscle recovery and
is included in digestive support in general. I am not very familiar
with it.

#### Nutrient deficiency

I already take supplements for important nutrients missing from a
vegan diet, such as Vitamin D, B12, omega-3, calcium/magnesium/zinc. I
take occasional Vitamin B complex supplements, though I expect my
dietary intake to be close to sufficient.

There are other possibilities though:

* Potassium: My 31-day moving average of consumption is a little below
  the 3400 mg daily minimum (but not that much below!). I think a
  comprehensive metabolic panel could rule that out. When I got one in
  April, I was fine on potassium, but my diet patterns have changed
  since then.

* Sodium: My 31-day moving average of consumption, excluding added
  table salt that is hard to quantify, is less than the daily
  recommended minimum, but I think my added table salt probably makes
  up the difference. A comprehensive metabolic panel could rule that
  out.

* Copper: A copper/magnesium/zinc panel could help check this. I think
  I have enough dietary copper though.

* Magnesium: Already in my supplements, but is there interference?

#### FODMAP sensitivity

I did notice reduced flatulence after stopping peas, increased
flatulence when I tried lentils, and more flatulence following onion
consumption. This suggests some FODMAP sensitivity, but this is just a
symptom and not a cause. FODMAP sensitivity does support the SIBO
cluster of causes, and in particular supports IMO as a potential
cause.

#### Digestive enzyme deficiency

Some of this overlaps with nutrient deficiency, but some of it could
be the body making fewer digestive enzymes. Or, there could be enzymes
that the body doesn't make but that taking them would help with some
symptoms by preventing undigested food from reaching the large
intestine (e.g., cellulase digests cellulose).

I did get tested for lipase last time and it did come out to be normal.

## Beginning of the story: the night before and the day of (2024-07-18)

### Background from the previous night (2024-07-17 night)

It's rather hot during the afternoon, and I needed to stock up on
food, so in anticipation of needing to go out shopping in the morning,
I went to sleep a little earlier (by about 1.5 hours) compared to my
usual. Specifically, I went to sleep around 10:30 PM, compared to the
past few days of about midnight (ironically, the late sleeping time in
the recent past was itself driven by the heat making it hard to go to
sleep earlier).

### Background on morning activity on 2024-07-18

I woke up around 6:40 AM, about 1.5 hours earlier than usual, which
was likely because of sleeping earlier.

Since I woke up early enough, I decided to both go jogging *and* do my
morning shopping trip.

I needed to be back home for a meeting at 10:30 AM. The way this ended
up working out is that I went jogging from 8:20 AM to 8:45 AM, then
got back and headed out pretty quickly thereafter shortly after 9
AM. I got back around 10:20 AM, just in time for my meeting.

Overall, I walked + jogged almost 5 miles, with jogging making up
about 1.7 miles. Fortunately, I didn't carry back a heavy load of
stuff. But keep in mind that this 5 miles was before I had eaten
anything in the morning.

Then, after coming back home, I did my meeting, then wrapped up a few
items, then proceeded with my potatoes prep. I was finally done and
started eating my first meal of the day at around 1:15 PM. I also did
a meeting with a couple of work colleagues while eating, and the
eating and meeting wrapped up around 2:20 PM.

Given the large amount of running + walking, I probably ended up
eating a bit more than usual.

### Experience later in the afternoon

I felt heaviness in my abdomen (likely my stomach area) and didn't
feel very energetic. Later, that translated to a bit of abdominal
pain. The pain was lesser when standing and moving around.

A few other complications:

* It was a little hot but not too hot in the afternoon, which may have
  added to my fatigue and lethargy.

* The meal itself had potatoes, peas, broccoli, kale, and sauerkraut,
  all of which can be heavy on the stomach. But it was my typical meal
  -- nothing unusual.

* In the previous days, I had experienced intermittent (not
  persistent) abdominal discomfort due to excess lemon consumption and
  the consumption of lentils.

The heaviness didn't get to a distracting level of pain, and I had my
second meal without incident a litle after 6 PM.

## Subsequent days

### Next day (2024-07-19)

On 2024-07-19, things were fine in the morning. I still went out
jogging and jogged a good amount (about 1.7 miles, 0.3 miles return
walk). I experienced some abdominal pain later in the afternoon. It
was less than on 2024-07-18, but there was also more heat-related
fatigue and disorientation, so on net I may have felt worse. With that
said, my productivity/output seemed pretty good, and I executed on
both physical and mental work.

### Two days later (2024-07-20)

On this day, I had to go shopping, so I skipped jogging in the morning
to avoid the fiasco of 2024-07-18.

I did breath holds in the morning before going shopping, and perhaps
because of that, felt a little out-of-breath initially when
walking. However, I was back to normal later in the journey.

When I got back, I took a pulse oximeter reading, getting 55-67 bpm
with the typical range being 59-64 bpm.

### Three days later (2024-07-21)

This day I again pulled something vaguely similar to 2024-07-18: I
went jogging, then did strength exercises, then shortly after that I
went shopping.

However, the jogging was a little less extreme (about 1.5 miles
jogging / 0.5 miles walking), I rested a few minutes before going out,
and my outside trip was not as far off. So, I did not have the same
degree of fatigue-causing stimuli.

However, I had [finger injuries](2024-07-21-finger-injuries.md) that
caused me some physical and mental stress. Also, due to these, I was
trying to space out my urination (to give the finger injury time to
heal). These factors may have been responsible for an increase in
abdominal discomfort toward the later afternoon, and a reduced
appetite for my second meal of the day. There was a brief period where
I was feeling particularly crappy, though it didn't last too long.

### Four days later (2024-07-22)

On 2024-07-22, I was mostly fine but did experience slight discomfort
off and on, and more pronounced discomfort a few times.

### Five days later (2024-07-23)

On 2024-07-23, I again experienced slight discomfort and it was a
little more acute later in the day.

### Six days later (2024-07-24)

Factor X applied.

Going to sleep on the night of 2024-07-23, I had been thinking of
skipping exercise on 2024-07-24 to give myself more room for a fuller
recovery. I ended up doing this on the morning of 2024-07-24. I also
stayed in bed a little longer than my natural inclination, to get the
benefits of more sleep.

Already on the morning of 2024-07-24, I was feeling a little more
pronounced and frequent discomfort than the past two days. This
continued low-key through the day. I don't know if this was due to the
deliberate decision to have a slow day and not go out, and don't know
if this represents a worsening or is the recovery process in action.

### Seven days later (2024-07-25)

Having gone to sleep early the previous night (2024-07-24), I stayed
in bed a little longer, so that I got over 8.5 hours in bed.

I did all my usual exercises, including jogging and strength exercises.

I did notice what felt like excess stomach acid (as evidenced by
burping and a little bit of flatulence), but it wasn't
super-pronounced, and it only got a little more pronounced due to
delays with eating. It was fine after eating and didn't get in the way
of my mood for most of the day.

### Eight days later (2024-07-26)

I was feeling worse on this day (between my first and second meal)
than the previous day. I narrowed down two causes of the difference:

* I had gotten more sleep overnight on the previous day.

* I consumed vegan probiotic yogurt in the first meal on the previous
  day, and didn't consume it in the first meal on this day.

I remedied the second factor by consuming vegan probiotic yogurt in
the second meal, and I did feel relatively better (almost as well as
the previous day) in the period between the second meal and going to
sleep.

### Nine days later (2024-07-27)

I followed the identified best practices and was feeling generally
good through the day, though my total accounted-for hours were a bit
low.

### Ten days later (2024-07-28)

Despite trying to follow best practices, I didn't feel as good as the
previous day, though still better than two days and four days
ago. There were a few specific things that happened today:

* Maybe slight rushing of morning bowel movement due to a timer going
  off that I needed to turn off (though I did feel like I finished up).

* Potatoes/peas prep and more consumption of that (my mixed veggies
  were over).

* A decent amount of cleaning activity after meal, and in general a
  lot of physical moving around activity; ironically I felt fine
  during the activity but settling down right after it I experienced
  more discomfort.

* The fragmented nature of the day meant I did not get deep
  intellectual engagement which tends to drive out thoughts of the
  discomfort.

I did notice that my discomfort would peak right before urination and
I'd feel pretty normal after urination. This has been an observation
in the past as well, but was particularly pronounced today.

### Eleven days later (2024-07-29)

I felt mostly good through the day, with occasional abdominal
discomfort right at the peak of urine buildups.

### Twelve days later (2024-07-30)

I continued to feel good through most of the day; in fact, this was
probably my best day in a while. However, I did continue to experience
similar symptoms as before. Late in the day, I experienced more pain
than usual, but urination helped reduce the pain.

### Thirteen days later (2024-07-31)

Factor X applied.

I was feeling more pain than usual this morning. Considering that this
was also the case the last time factor X had applied (2024-07-24) I
now suspect factor X to be an aggravator.

I did two unusual things later in the day:

* I started a break from sauerkraut. I'm planning to sustain this
  break for a week and then reassess.

* I decided to try a bowel movement in the afternoon at around 3
  PM. Surprisingly, a bowel movement happened without effort on my
  part (even though I didn't feel a strong urge for one). This
  suggests to me that perhaps the issue is incomplete bowel movements
  in the morning, despite feeling satisfied shortly after the bowel
  movement. But it's unclear if today was unusual. I'm planning to try
  a bowel movement a few more times in the future.

  I did notice a little bleeding when wiping after the bowel movement,
  but it didn't seem too concerning. I didn't experience any
  pain. I'll keep an eye out for bleeding in the future, and make sure
  that for any low-pressure bowel movements I don't try to push stuff
  out forcefully which might make bleeding worse.

I felt relieved after the bowel movement though not "perfectly fine"
so I don't think this alone did the trick. I continued to be
approximately in this good state till my next meal and then for a
couple of hours afterward; however, I had more pronounced sensations
of discomfort around 9 PM as I settled into sedentary work. The
sensations continued till before I went to sleep, though there were
times in between where it didn't feel unpleasant at all.

### Fourteen days later (2024-08-01)

As for the last few days, I felt a little reflux in my throat when I
woke up though it wasn't enough to make my voice hoarse.

I generally felt reasonably good in the morning, though the discomfort was still present.

These are my notes from the morning, taken shortly before I went jogging:

* Burping: yes (started early on)
* Rumble: yes and audible (growing to a rumble over time)
* Flatulence: no
* Tenesmus: no
* Pain level: 0, occasionally a 1 (i.e., I noticed it (0) and it was occasionally unpleasant (1) but it didn’t disturb or distract me physically)

Notes taken a little over an hour after my meal:

* Burping: yes (off and on)
* Rumble: nothing audible
* Flatulence: occasional, slight
* Tenesmus: no
* Pain level: 0 (i.e., I noticed it (0) but didn't rise to the level 1 where it was unpleasant)

Overall notes: I consider this my best day among recent days. The
afternoon/evening were particularly great. The pain level was almost
always around a 0 and in most cases I wasn't even thinking about
it. It did spike to a 1 occasionally.

However, even though I think I could "live" with this, I still want to
try the potatoes/peas/broccoli/kale elimination and will then
reintroduce potatoes/broccoli/kale after 3 days of abstinence and wait
about a week before introducing peas or lentils. I'll continue
consuming the yogurt at an elevated rate for the time being. I do want
to get to the state of actual good health versus just a zero-pain
functioning state. My hope is that once I get to the state of actual
good health I can taper off the yogurt, resume some peas/lentils
consumption, resume sauerkraut consumption, return to sleeping less,
and then see if I continue to maintain the good health. With that
said, I'm still happy to at least have a working level of good health
that I can sustain / fall back to.

### Fifteen days later (2024-08-02)

This was an unusual day. I went to San Francisco to meet a couple of
people in the afternoon. As a result, I skipped exercise in the
morning.

My pain level was at a 0 through the day. I had minor amounts of
burping and flatulence -- still more than my healthy state but less
than the last few days. I was able to suppress these even more while
hanging out with others, so that I could function well in the
interaction.

### Sixteen days later (2024-08-03)

Going into the day, there are two factors working against me:

* Less sleep than usual: I got 7 hours of sleep; I went to sleep at
  12:55 AM and got up around 7:50 AM. This is fine for normal times
  but less than the extended sleep I've been trying to get these days.

* Factor X applied, though it was different than usual and hopefully
  less bad than the other occurrences.

Despite these headwinds, this was my best day in a while. For large
parts of the day, I had no issues. The occasional pain was mostly at
level ero where I was aware of it but it didn't distract me.

### Seventeen days later (2024-08-04)

Going into the day, the main factor working against me was that I only
got 7 hours 40 minutes of sleep, which isn't too little on its own,
but low considering that the previous day I had only 7 hours of sleep.

I had much less bowel pressure than usual, so I went for bowel
movement a little later in the day, and it didn't come out that
quickly, though the overall volume was only slightly less than usual.

Things were great in the morning and until my meal prep and
eating. However, after eating, I noticed slight abdominal heaviness --
a 0 rating of pain. I also felt a bit of generalized fatigue and
tingling. However, for the most part I continued with my work as usual.

Around 6:30 PM I decided to see if I have buildup for a bowel
movement, so I tried to pass stool, but nothing came out. I gave up
after a few minutes, as was my plan. However, in hindsight maybe I
should have tried to strain even less (I tried keeping straining to a
minimum, but should have aimed for even less).

### Eighteen days later (2024-08-05)

Having gone to sleep around 11:15 PM last night, I woke up initially at
6:47 AM to urinate, then went back to bed and properly got up around
7:30 AM. I had stronger bowel pressure than usual, so I had to go for
bowel movement with less buildup time than usual. Retrospectively, I
feel like some of the ingredients in the Kitava meal (including the
onions) may have had some unexpected destabilizing effects on my bowel
movement cycle, though the lesser sleep on Friday and Saturday were
also likely contributing factors (but I do think the extra work I was
able to do and the flow I was able to get into due to that made it
worthwhile).

I had off-and-on zero rating pain in the morning; it was off my mind
for most of my Amazon package pickup trip but it was there.

I had a more on-my-mind zero rating pain after eating, and the pain
very occasionally crossed to a 1.

Roughly speaking, I think this was comparable to last Tuesday and not
as good as last Thursday, but it's difficult to compare very precisely
(and maybe I psychologically felt better Thursday due to the upward
trajectory, even though I wasn't materially better on
Thursday). Definitely, there seems to have been a regression since
last Saturday. I'm wondering if my stoppage of potatoes prep is
leading to a protein shortage that is causing other issues,
considering that I felt pretty much recovered on Saturday. Or if there
is just some residual effect of the Kitava meal that will die out in a
day or two so I just need to brave through it. I'll continue observing
until tomorrow afternoon/evening to figure out if things are getting
better or worse.

I think one way the current symptoms feel a little different than last
week is that there is a more pronounced sense of fatigue/lethargy,
though the fatigue/lethargy is not huge in absolute terms, and I'm
still continuing to do stuff at close to my usual speed and intensity.

After dinner, I got engrossed in the stuff I was doing and overall the
abdominal discomfort was less salient. It's not clear to me if it
actually receded or I was just more engrossed in my work and therefore
thought about it less.

### Nineteen days later (2024-08-06)

While mostly feeling better in the morning, I had a couple of concerning things:

* More pain than usual, though less stomach rumble and less burping
  and flatulence most of the time. But the pain was mild.

* My second breath hold could last only 32 seconds, due to
  chest/abdominal pain.

I decided to skip strength exercises today due to a mix of time
constraints and wanting to avoid exacerbating the pain. Also, since I
did heavy lifting yesterday for my Amazon package pickup, I think it's
fine to skip strength exercises.

Through the day, I'd say that it was a mix of feeling at my worst of
the past week, while also feeling like the pain has peaked and things
are gonna get better now. I'm not sure how much my psychology was
influencing my read of the pain. But I feel intuitively that the
onions played some role, even though it's now four days since I had
them.

### Twenty days later (2024-08-07)

This day seemed to be great, so I think my intuition of the previous
day being the beginning of a turnaround was correct.

* My breath hold numbers were back to normal. Exercise-wise the only
  unusual thing is that I couldn't fully close the 150 lb with my left
  hand (the right hand was fine). I tried a few times later in the day
  and was only able to close it once. Occasional inability to close
  the 150 lb with one hand is not unusual, and it may be unrelated to
  the topic of this document.

* I noticed abdominal issues for a smaller fraction of the day, and
  most of the time I did, the pain level was a 0 (i.e., not getting in
  my way).

* I also had way less of burping, flatulence, and stomach rumble
  through the day (though I had more flatulence in the morning prior
  to bowel movement).

* I was high on energy and in my general spirits.

I'm currently inclining to the hypothesis that this is a FODMAP issue,
with the initial trigger being peas and sauerkraut after overexertion
(these foods are tolerated by me under normal circumstances, but not
under the overexertion circumstances), and the reason for the recent
brief regression being the Kitava meal that included onions.

My plan is to gently resume lentils, peas, and sauerkraut at low doses
while closely monitoring symptoms.

### Twenty-one days later (2024-08-08)

This day was worse than the previous day, but still overall pretty good.

I had gone to sleep a little later the previous day, due to an evening
grocery store trip and in general feeling higher-energy. Still, not
too much later than usual -- I did get into bed around 11:18 PM and go
to sleep around 11:40 PM.

However, the result of this was that I did not get my target 8.5 hours
of sleep. I first got out of bed to urinate at around 7 AM, but then
went back to bed and eventually got out of bed at around 7:25 AM. So
it was a total of about 7 hours 45 minutes of sleep, which is not too
bad, but not ideal.

This was also my first time having lentils since the beginning of this
round of abdominal pain, though I had had peas and onions previously,
and I think lentils would be lower-FODMAP given my preparation. I
didn't have a lot.

It was after my first meal that I started feeling clear-cut pain and a
general dampening of spirits. But I astutely identified the
possibility of incomplete bowel evacuation in the morning as a
contributing factor, so about two hours after my meal I went for a
bowel movement and had a successful one (even though I was not feeling
a lot of bowel pressure per se). After the bowel movement I was back
to feeling upbeat, though it still wasn't as good as yesterday.

I had a little bit (equivalent of about 1/3 of my cup) of lentils with
my dinner meal. I felt some discomfort for about 1-2 hours after the
meal, which reduced as time passed by. Based on the characteristics of
the discomfort, I suspect that the lentils consumption (combined over
my two meals) was one of the factors, so my current plan is to stay
off for at least two days of feeling good (at a level comparable to
Wednesday). This means that the earliest I would resume is Sunday,
assuming that Friday and Saturday go well. Moreover, when resuming, I
should limit to one meal and to 1/4 cup in that one meal, and then
only on the day after that should I ramp up to levels comparable to
today.

#### An idea regarding lentils preparation (idea at night, execution waiting for a future date)

I follow the practice of soaking lentils overnight, then draining the
excess water, then adding more water and cooking the lentils. Draining
the initial excess water is recommended practice for getting rid of
the FODMAPs that tend to be water-soluble and are therefore likely to
have moved from the lentils into the water.

However, I don't do an exhaustive draining of water -- I basically
drain the water that's easily drained but I don't pass it through a
strainer or equivalent. So my suspicion is that if I were to drain out
the water more fully -- both after the initial soaking and after the
subsequent cooking -- the FODMAP content of the lentils would be much
lower.

I can't go back and change what I did after initial soaking, but I can
drain out the excess water now to quite an extent (it won't be
perfect). I might end up losing a few lentils here and there in the
process, but if overall it allows me to actually consume the lentils
that's a win.

Other than FODMAP theory, here's another piece of evidence in favor of
this. For past stuff like peas and onions, the symptoms have appeared
over an extended period of time and taken even longer to peter out. On
the other hand, for the lentils consumption, I immediately started
feeling bad, and then started feeling relief over a period of 1-2
hours, and this happened for both meals (although I didn't quite get
back to the level of Wednesday). That kind of rapid pattern of onset
and recovery seems to be more consistent with liquids than solids,
since liquids go through the digestive system more quickly, and
water-soluble stuff therefore also gets removed more quickly.

I think I'll still keep the two-days-feeling-good rule for before I
resume lentils consumption, but I might do the draining in advance (if
nothing else it should free up some space in the refrigerator that
would otherwise not get freed up with my pause of consumption; it will
also allow for quicker completion once I do resume).

### Twenty-two days later (2024-08-09)

I had a mostly normal day but the pain was still there, a zero for a
lot of the day but enough to remind me of its presence. There were,
however, periods of the day when the pain wasn't there at all though I
still did feel something in the area indicating that there was some
heaviness. The pain was highest in the 1-2 hours after meals but it
wasn't very clearly monotonic. For the most part, the pain also didn't
get in the way of my spirits and enthusiasm.

Overall, this was better than yesterday for the most part, but not as
good as last Saturday or Wednesday.

### Twenty-three days later (2024-08-10)

My bowel movement in the morning was bigger than usual despite me
sleeping a little less than usual, and it felt like I was getting some
of the extra stuff out.

I had a mostly normal day. The pain was still there, a zero for a lot
of the day but still enough to remind me every now and then. Overall,
my mood was better than yesterday, but not by a *lot*. I'd say that
this was still not as good of a day as this past Wednesday or the
previous Saturday, but it seems to be getting there.

### Twenty-four days later (2024-08-11)

Notes taken in the morning: I had slightly less sleep than ideal, but
this was due to sleeping early and waking up early, so I think my body
was done with sleep. I also had a satisfying bowel movement. While I
still experience some pain, it feels more like the pain after the bad
stuff is out and the body is finally healing. So my guess is that it's
nervous sensitivity and that it should heal in another day or two.

Update the next day: I would say my morning description generally
described the day as a whole. By the afternoon/evening I was pretty
upbeat, even though there was still some intermittent abdominal
discomfort.

### Twenty-five days later (2024-08-12)

Notes taken in the morning: I overall had a similar experience as the
previous morning, though I'd say that on the whole the pain was even
less early in the morning. However, there was more distinctive
"stomach rumble" (albeit more below the belly button) after I returned from
jogging and before I had my first meal.

Notes taken at night shortly before wrapping up: After my first meal,
I first more fullness than usual (with some pain), but less "activity"
than I have felt in the past. The pain was also limited to being below
the belly. The pain subsided after a couple of hours. There was some
fullness but not as much pain after the second meal. Overall, my sense
is that this is similar to last Tuesday (2024-08-06) though the qualia
are a bit different.

### Twenty-six days later (2024-08-13)

Notes taken in the afternoon/evening about 1.5 hours after finishing
my first meal: I was woken up at around 6:25 AM by an alert that
turned out to be non-critical. I did go back to sleep and woke up
properly a little after 7 AM. Overall, I had a little over 8 hours of
sleep (I had gone to sleep around 11 PM) but the unplanned
interruption may have slightly disrupted me.

I overall had a similar qualititative feel as yesterday, with the pain
limited to being below the belly button, and being a more persistent
though lighter-grade pain. I skipped jogging and instead did an
administrative trip, that was less intensive but longer. After coming
back, I continued with admin work so delayed my first meal.

Around 1:30 PM, I decided to try a second bowel movement to see if it
would help me. I did have a small bowel movement and felt better after
that. I then had my meal that I really enjoyed, more than I've been
enjoying meals so far.

Unlike yesterday, I did not have an increase in pain after eating,
which might be due to the second bowel movement. However, the pain did
not subside entirely either.

Despite the continuation of the pain, in some ways I felt much better
and more optimistic, which might be by GI system telling my mind that
things are getting back to normal, or it could be my mind
hallucinating.

The symptoms do seem to resemble cramps that could be a result of the
"die-off" of the bad bacteria. See for instance
[here](https://gutpowerdrinks.com/blogs/blog/sibo-die-off-symptoms)
though that is about SIBO whereas at this point I think I just have
dysbiosis which affects the large intestine, as opposed to SIBO that
also affects the small intestine. But I think the general idea should
apply.

The thing that's different from last time is that I've now had this
"die-off" type symptoms for two days, whereas last time those symptoms
had lasted just one day (Tuesday 2024-08-06) and the next day
(Wednesday 2024-08-07) had been kinda great.

Notes taken for the evening (entered the next morning): Things kinda
remained about the same, but my mood improved even further in the
evening.

### Twenty-seven days later (2024-08-14)

#### Notes taken in the morning

I had a sharp increase in the pain briefly in the first hour or so of
trying to sleep on the night of 2024-08-13, but the increase in pain
actually improved my spirits because I feel like it reflects
progress. The pain stayed below the belly button and shifted around a
little bit, but was tolerable.

When I woke up in the morning, after a little while I had a strong
urge for bowel movement (stronger than usual) and the movement
happened a bit more quickly than usual. After bowel movement, I felt
relatively good. I still feel a bit more sensation below the belly but
it's more like fatigue than pain, and more like a gentle lightness
than cramping. I did, however, notice some burping so there's a risk
things are going in circles, but I'm cautiously optimistic.

I'm skipping exercise today to help with this stage of healing.

#### Notes taken in the evening before my second meal

Remarkably, I was able to carry out a conversation with work
colleagues for over 4 hours, without being much distracted by the
pain, and without needing to go urinate. I was not feeling totally
okay before the conversation, so I suspect that part of it was the
sympathetic activation induced by the conversation, but it's still
remarkable because for a similar conversation 3 weeks ago, I had been
feeling uneasy within an hour of conversation (with that said, another
conversation the next day that lasted 2 hours proceeded great).

The conversation ended up delaying my first meal quite a bit.

After the conversation, my situation was roughly like this:

* Discomfort sensations were limited to being below the belly.

* Pain was off and on, generally a zero when it was on.

* Even when I wasn't feeling pain, I did notice some unusualness in
  the area.

* There wasn't much flatulence.

My mood was pretty good overall, like yesterday.

It's not totally clear if I am making progress, but at least I don't
seem to be slipping backward.

#### Notes taken at night (around 10:20 PM)

I'm contining to experience the pain in the form of cramping-like
stuff, as a dull continuing pain, but most of the time it's not
salient to me. I was able to make reasonable progress on a mix of
mechanical and intellectual tasks.

### Twenty-eight days later (2024-08-15)

#### Notes taken in the afternoon (around 2:30 PM) around two hours after my first meal

I had a relatively normal morning. I continued to skip exercise per
the plan. The pain was still limited to being below the belly button.

I did morning shopping and it worked fine.

I was feeling a little more bothered by the pain in the morning than
the previous day, though I don't know if the degree of pain was
higher.

After eating, I had a brief period when I felt low-energy, influenced
by the pain and a general sense of lethargy. I decided to try a bowel
movement. While the movement was brief and small, perhaps the extra
gas release or other factors in it helped me feel a lot better, and I
was back to my normal of the last few days after that, though still a
bit lethargic.

### Twenty-nine days later (2024-08-16)

The notes for this day were taken the next morning
(2024-08-17). Ironically I spent a lot of time on 2024-08-16 updating
the overall notes but did not spend any time adding notes for the day
itself!

Overall, the day was fairly similar to the last few days. I continued
not going to exercise, but did have other chores that led me to make
brief outside trips, so I got some basic level of activity. Unlike the
previous day, I had a seemingly complete bowel movement in the morning
and did not feel the need to try in the afternoon. Overall I had a
productive day, but the pain was still very much present and stayed in
the "below the belly button" center/right area. I did notice
occasional elevated sensation in my back (particularly the spinal
cord) along with increases in pain, but the spinal cord sensations
were not notable in and of themselves.

### Thirty days later (2024-08-17)

Start of portion coppied from the [2024 exercise
tracker](2024-exercise-tracker.md):

When jogging, I noticed a slight
pain that seemed to be coming from my lower right area. After
completing 1.1 miles, I decided that the pain, though mild, was
consistent enough that I should stop and walk back. As I walked back,
the pain subsided and seemingly shifted around a little bit, so I do
think the act of jogging in particular triggered the increase in pain.

In light of this, I plan to skip jogging for at least a week and
monitor the progress of my symptoms.

End of portion copied.

Further thoughts:

* Does this reflect the locus of the pain overall shifting to my lower
  right side? Or is it something jogging-specific that seems to attack
  the right side?

* If the pain is shifting to the right side on the whole, is this
  evidence consistent with the intestinal methanogen overgrowth /
  (appendix as the reservoir of methanogens) theory?

### Thirty-one days later (2024-08-18)

This summary was added the next morning (2024-08-19).

My symptoms seem to be more clearly shifting in the direction of pain,
and the role of right side pain relative to central pain seems to have
increased. Direct GI tract symptoms such as stomach rumble,
flatulence, and burping seem to have further reduced.

### Thirty-two days later (2024-08-19)

This summary was added the next morning (2024-08-20).

My symptoms stayed mostly similar to the past few days: not much by
way of gas, reflux, stomach rumble, or perceived
constipation/tenesmus, but continued mild pain. The pain was initially
on the center and right side, but toward the end of the day seemed to
shift more to the center and to slightly left of center (but not to
the left side). The extent to which I noticed the pain during my daily
activities also seemed to reduce slightly.

### Thirty-three days later (2024-08-20)

This summary was added the afternoon of the next day (2024-08-21).

Ny symptoms stayed mostly similar to the past few days: I did not have
any noticeable gas, reflux, stomach rumble, or perceived
constipation/tenesmus. I had continued mild pain, ranging from a 0 to
a 1, in the same area as the previous day: below the belly button in
the center and slight left, and occasionally shifting to the right
area.

There were large parts of the day where the pain wasn't noticeable,
and even periods of the day where I could not even notice anything
unusual even after trying to focus on the area (unless I tensed it).

### Thirty-four days later (2024-08-21)

This summary was added the morning of the next day (2024-08-22).

My symptoms stayed mostly similar to the past few days; for the most
part, I did not have any noticeable gas, reflux, stomach rumble, or
perceived constipation/tenesmus. I had continued mild pain, ranging
from a 0 to a 1, in the same area as the previous day: below the belly
button in the center and slight left, and occasionally shifting to the
right area.

However, shortly after dinner I felt a bit heavier than usual. I think
the greater proportion of kale in my dinner meal may have resulted in
some of the symptoms. I also had slightly more flatulence than usual,
though nowhere near as much as when I had been having peas, lentils,
sauerkraut, and broccoli.

### Thirty-five days later (2024-08-22)

This summary was added the morning of the next day (2024-08-23).

My symptoms stayed mostly similar to the past few days; for the most
part, I did not have any noticeable gas, reflux, stomach rumble, or
perceived constipation/tenesmus. I had continued mild pain, ranging
from a 0 to a 1, in the same area as the previous day: below the belly
button in the center and slight left, and occasionally shifting to the
right area.

However, there were a few slightly different things:

* Brief increase in gas and burping and general sense of constipation
  in the late morning, before my first meal. This self-resolved.

* Occasional brief sensations of pain (like muscle aches) above the
  belly, including near the bottom of my right rib cage. These lasted
  only a few seconds.

My mood / energy levels were pretty good for most of the day, even
better than previous days.

### Thirty-six days later (2024-08-23)

This summary was added the morning of the next day (2024-08-24).

My symptoms stayed mostly similar to the past few days, though were
lesser in frequency; for the most part, I did not have any noticeable
gas, reflux, stomach rumble, or perceived constipation/tenesmus. I had
sporadic mild pain, ranging from a 0 to a 1, in the same area as the
previous day: below the belly button in the center and slight left,
and occasionally shifting to the right area.

The pain became a bit clearer late at night about 2-3 hours after
dinner, but did not escalate much, and it subsided again.

### Thirty-seven days later (2024-08-24)

This summary was added the morning of the next day (2024-08-25).

My symptoms were pretty similar to the previous day (2024-08-23). My
energy levels were pretty good.

This was the day I received and started taking readings with the
FoodMarble Aire 2. Readings are being recorded
[here](../../sql/foodmarble_aire_2_breath_tests.sql). I'm planning to
take multiple readings per day for the next week to get a good
baseline, then figure out an ongoing frequency of readings that makes
sense. The readings so far are suggestive of intestinal methanogen
overgrowth (IMO).

## Current learnings

I was updating [best practices around abdominal
discomfort](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-abdominal-discomfort.md)
early on, but it doesn't reflect a lot of the more speculative
learnings I have had more recently.
