# 2024-10-02: Atrantil purchase

On 2024-10-02, I purchased Atrantil, a total of 90 capsules. The
recommended dose is about 6 (2 per meal for 3 meals) when trying to
fix issues, and 2-3 for maintenance dosing.

On 2024-10-07, I picked up the purchased Atrantil.

My plan, as of 2024-10-08, was to start experimenting with taking the
Atrantil in a few days, once I have finished my [2024-10-09 dental
cleaning](2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md).

However, the resurgence of some level of abdomainal pain on 2024-10-08
and 2024-10-09 led me to decide to start with Atrantil on
2024-10-09. I took one capsule on the evening of 2024-10-09, to see if
there was any (positive or negative) reaction. After confirming no
negative reaction, I upped to two capsules the morning of
2024-10-10. My plan is to continue at 2 capsules a day until
2024-10-16 and then reassess. For more on the abdominal discomfort
symptoms and their evolution, see
