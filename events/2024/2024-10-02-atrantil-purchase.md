# 2024-10-02: Atrantil purchase

On 2024-10-02, I purchased Atrantil, a total of 90 capsules. The
recommended dose is about 6 (2 per meal for 3 meals) when trying to
fix issues, and 2-3 for maintenance dosing.

On 2024-10-07, I picked up the purchased Atrantil.

My plan, as of 2024-10-08, was to start experimenting with taking the
Atrantil in a few days, once I have finished my [2024-10-09 dental
cleaning](2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md).

However, the resurgence of some level of abdomainal pain on 2024-10-08
and 2024-10-09 led me to decide to start with Atrantil on
2024-10-09. I took one dose on the evening of 2024-10-09, to see if
there was any (positive or negative) reaction. My plan, as of
2024-10-09, is to transition to taking two doses of Atrantil daily for
a week, and see how it affects my new round of abdominal pain. But I'm
not sure if I'll begin this immediately on 2024-10-10 or continue at
one dose a day for a few days to confirm no adverse impact.
