# 2024-10-02: Atrantil purchase

On 2024-10-02, I purchased Atrantil, a total of 90 capsules. The
recommended dose is about 6 (2 per meal for 3 meals) when trying to
fix issues, and 2-3 for maintenance dosing.

On 2024-10-07, I picked up the purchased Atrantil.

My plan, as of 2024-10-08, is to start experimenting with taking the
Atrantil in a few days, once I have finished my [2024-10-09 dental
cleaning](2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md).

My dosing plan is as follows:

* 1 dose a day for a week

* Pause for a week and introspect on the symptoms (including
  subjective abdominal discomfort and fermentation scores)

* Up to 2 doses a day for a week

* Pause for a week and introspect on the symptoms (including
  subjective abdominal discomfort and fermentation scores)

* Then decide whether I want to continue dosing, never take it again,
  or pause dosing under normal conditions while being ready to take it
  under specific conditions
