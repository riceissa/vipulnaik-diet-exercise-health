# 2024-08-14: unplanned fast

On 2024-08-14, a monthly call for general catchup with work colleagues
ended up going longer than usual. I had not had a chance to eat prior
to the call, and I started noticing my throat getting a little
fatigued at around the 4-hour mark. So I started sipping some water. I
made sure to follow the [best practices around
fasting](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-fasting.md); in
particular, I made sure to have a decent amount of water in multiple
rounds before eating, and I skipped walnuts in my meal (I was anyway
abstaining from sauerkraut as part of dealing with my [abdominal
pain](2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md)).

I ended up eating at around 2:50 PM; my previous meal had ended around
7:25 PM.

My hope is that with the best practices, I don't have any comeuppance.
