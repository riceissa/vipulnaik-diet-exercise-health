# 2024-11-29: reduced hearing in left ear

On 2024-11-29, when I woke up in the morning, I noticed that my left
ear felt a bit compressed. I also noticed that audio seemed to be a
little less loud than usual, though I could still hear it clearly.

In the evening, I decided to do a test with my computer. I played a
single tune and shifted the microphone balance from 100% left to 100%
right. Overall, the 100% right felt a little louder (about 1.5x). I
also verified that when the balance was at 50% it felt a little louder
in my right ear, and moving it to about the 40:60 mark led to the
balance feeling even.

I also compared volume levels to confirm this ratio of about 1.5 (a
volume of 1.5x in the left ear felt like the same subjective volume as
1x in the right ear).

Unfortunately I don't have a prior benchmark to know whether my
hearing was balanced between the ears earlier.

I'll continue monitoring for the next few days and see if the hearing
situation persists.
