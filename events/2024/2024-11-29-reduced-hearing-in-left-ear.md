# 2024-11-29: reduced hearing in left ear

On 2024-11-29, when I woke up in the morning, I noticed that my left
ear felt a bit compressed. I also noticed that audio seemed to be a
little less loud than usual, though I could still hear it clearly.

In the evening, I decided to do a test with my computer. I played a
single tune and shifted the microphone balance from 100% left to 100%
right. Overall, the 100% right felt a little louder (about 1.5x). I
also verified that when the balance was at 50% it felt a little louder
in my right ear, and moving it to about the 40:60 mark led to the
balance feeling even.

I also compared volume levels to confirm this ratio of about 1.5 (a
volume of 1.5x in the left ear felt like the same subjective volume as
1x in the right ear).

Unfortunately I don't have a prior benchmark to know whether my
hearing was balanced between the ears earlier.

My suspicion as of 2024-11-29 is that this is because I slept for a
long time on my left side. In fact, hearing in both ears may be
reduced somewhat, but the left side is differentially more affected
and that's what I am noticing. Based on Googling, it does seem like
sleeping on one side for long can be a contributor to more earwax
buildup that can reduce hearing. My guess is that this will subside
after some time, but my plan is to sleep more on my right side to help
address the issue.

I'll continue monitoring for the next few days and see if the hearing
situation persists.

UPDATE 2024-11-30: The situation seems similar (about a ratio of 1.5).

UPDATE 2024-12-02: The situation seems similar (about a ratio of 1.5).

UPDATE 2024-12-04: I feel like the situation is more balanced; the
ratio feels more like 1.25 now, and I don't feel that sense of
compression/heaviness in my left ear. I think this is close enough to
balanced, but I plan to do another check on 2024-12-07.

UPDATE 2024-12-07: The hearing balance seems to still be around a
ratio of 1.25. I've set a reminder to do another check on 2024-12-10.
