# 2024-11-29: reduced hearing in left ear

On 2024-11-29, when I woke up in the morning, I noticed that my left
ear felt a bit compressed. I also noticed that audio seemed to be a
little less loud than usual, though I could still hear it clearly.

In the evening, I decided to do a test with my computer. I played a
single tune and shifted the microphone balance from 100% left to 100%
right. Overall, the 100% right felt a little louder (about 1.5x). I
also verified that when the balance was at 50% it felt a little louder
in my right ear, and moving it to about the 40:60 mark led to the
balance feeling even.

I also compared volume levels to confirm this ratio of about 1.5 (a
volume of 1.5x in the left ear felt like the same subjective volume as
1x in the right ear).

Unfortunately I don't have a prior benchmark to know whether my
hearing was balanced between the ears earlier.

My suspicion as of 2024-11-29 is that this is because I slept for a
long time on my left side. In fact, hearing in both ears may be
reduced somewhat, but the left side is differentially more affected
and that's what I am noticing. Based on Googling, it does seem like
sleeping on one side for long can be a contributor to more earwax
buildup that can reduce hearing. My guess is that this will subside
after some time, but my plan is to sleep more on my right side to help
address the issue.

I'll continue monitoring for the next few days and see if the hearing
situation persists.

UPDATE 2024-11-30: The situation seems similar (about a ratio of 1.5).

UPDATE 2024-12-02: The situation seems similar (about a ratio of 1.5).

UPDATE 2024-12-04: I feel like the situation is more balanced; the
ratio feels more like 1.25 now, and I don't feel that sense of
compression/heaviness in my left ear. I think this is close enough to
balanced, but I plan to do another check on 2024-12-07.

UPDATE 2024-12-07: The hearing balance seems to still be around a
ratio of 1.25. I've set a reminder to do another check on 2024-12-10.

UPDATE 2024-12-10: The hearing balance seems to still be around a
ratio of 1.25. I've set a reminder to do another check on 2024-12-13.

UPDATE 2024-12-10: The hearing balance seems to still be around a
ratio of 1.25. I've set a reminder to do another check on 2024-12-13.

UPDATE 2024-12-13: The hearing balance seems to still be around a
ratio of 1.25. I've set a reminder to do another check on 2024-12-16
(later deferred to 2024-12-17).

UPDATE 2024-12-17: The hearing balance seems to still be around a
ratio of 1.25, though I now feel like it's hard to really
differentiate within the 1.25-1.5 range.

The persistence of this issue led me to decide to dig more deeply into
the topic.

## More comprehensive evaluation on 2024-12-17

### More thorough testing of minimum audible volume

My previous testing was based on testing when sounds are equally loud
to the left and right ear. However, that requires more of a subjective
judgment. I decided to do something different -- take a soundtrack and
find the minimum volume at which I could make out the words when
playing it into my left and right ear.

The Macbook Air has a gradation of 16 levels and 64 sub-levels (the
sub-levels can be accessed by pressing alt+shift while adjusting the
level up or down).

Here's what I found:

* With the right ear, I was able to hear and make out the words (for a
  known soundtrack) at the lowest level (1 out of 64).

* With the left ear, I needed to be at a level of around 14 out of 64
  to be able to make out the words.

I can't find a clear decibel mapping of the levels, but the
guesstimate is that the max volume is about 75-90 decibels, so
assuming linear increase in decibels with each gradation, starting at
0 dB for a gradation of 1, that's a difference of about 15 to 19
decibels in hearing between my ears. This seems significant -- my
right ear hearing seems fine whereas my left ear hearing seems to be
reduced.

I set the speakers to balanced at maximum volume.

Left ear:

* 500 Hz: very barely at 7 sometimes, definitely faintly at 8

* 1000 Hz: definitely faintly at 8

* 2000 Hz: very faintly at 9

* 4000 Hz: definitely faintly at 8

* Overall verdict: Possible loss; it's slightly in the yellow

Right ear:

* 500 Hz: very barely at 6 sometimes, definitely faintly at 7

* 1000 Hz: definitely faintly at 7

* 2000 Hz: definitely faintly at 5

* 4000 Hz: definitely faintly at 2

* Overall verdict: No loss detected; it's all green
