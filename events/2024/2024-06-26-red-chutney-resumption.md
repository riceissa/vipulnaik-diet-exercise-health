# 2024-06-26: red chutney resumption

From 2024-03-16 to 2024-04-24, I had five spinach masala dosas from
Udupi Palace, and as a result, I accumulated five red chutneys (my
general practice is to not have the red chutney along with the
takeout, but have it later, to reduce the risk of sore throat). I
ended up not having any of these red chutneys over that period. After
that, the [abdominal pain](2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md) and then the
travel to Portland led me to defer consuming the red chutneys.

On 2024-06-26, I decided to start consuming the red chutneys. The
current plan is to consume about one per week, with each one consumed
across one or two meals. However, I might pause the consumption if I
experience sore throat symptoms. I also plan to do this consumption in
a different meal than my sauerkraut consumption, as the sauerkraut +
red chutney combination is a recipe for a sore throat.
