# 2024-10-08 onward: abdominal discomfort and other symptoms

In all cases, the pain was below the belly button in the center and a
little bit on the sides. It had a bit of "somebody socked me" and a
bit of "I ate something bad" feels, without being either. It was
qualitatively close to what I experienced toward the end of the
previous round (starting with the [2024-07-18
incident](2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md)).

## Potential triggers leading up to this

### General triggers

* High heat: Bay Area heat wave for over a week as of 2024-10-08, with
  temperatures finally starting to drop on 2024-10-08 and getting to
  Bay Area normal levels on 2024-10-09.

* Rapid temperature drop after high heat: It could be that the issue
  wasn't just high heat but the big temperature drop from the high
  heat, which left my body reeling to adjust.

* Slightly reduced sleep quality and quantity (this is mostly driven
  by the heat meaning that I have fewer hours that I can get quality
  sleep).

* Physical exertion: I've made a point of trying to avoid the sort of
  extreme exertion that preceded my [2024-07-18
  incident](2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md). But,
  I have been ramping up my level of physical exercise.

* Cognitive exertion: By switching to watching/listening to videos
  during meal prep, post-meal ccleanup, and meal consumption, I've
  added a new category to cognitive exertion without taking anything
  out to compensate.

### Immediate triggers

2024-10-06 and 2024-10-07 were both "long days" with the former being
cognitively intense, and the latter being a mix of cognitively and
physically intense. I also didn't get as much sleep as I would in
better weather.

## 2024-10-08: abdominal discomfort symptoms resume

In the last few weeks, I've had residual symptoms from my [2024-07-18
  incident](2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md), but these have generally been brief, mild, and intermittent.

In contrast, the abdominal discomfort I experienced on 2024-10-08 had
two bouts that both lasted long enough and were distressing enough to
make me think about them, rather than being able to ignore them.

The two times in question were late morning / early afternoon and late
evening / early night. They coincided with the period around the
consumption of the first and second meal respectively.

Separate from the discomfort, I didn't have any other symptoms such as
a clear increase in flatlence. My fermentation reading from FoodMarble
(taken around the time the discomfort was starting to subside) came
pretty low for hydrogen and zero for methane, so it doesn't look like
(as of yet) fermentation of these two gases is driving things.

Other symptoms I experienced were right neck and shoulder fatigue and
general fatigue; I also observed increased urination, which is partly
due to temperature returning to normal but may also be indicative of
general pain in the area driving the need.

## 2024-10-09: abdominal discomfort recurs and I try Atrantil

On 2024-10-09, I noticed abdominal discomfort symptoms around 12:50 PM
when waiting for my dental cleaning. I had take care not to eat
fermentable foods recently, so that I wouldn't have to worry about
flatulence while being treated. However, even prior to this, in the
morning, I did notice the need for increased urination after my first
meal.

The discomfort lasted briefly but I was able to suppress it and got
through the dental cleaning without thinking about it.

The second noticeable round of symptoms started around 5 PM in the
evening, as I was getting ready to go to Trader Joe's. It continued in
the journey to Trader Joe's, and some of the journey back, but was
largely gone when I started potatoes prep.

With my second meal, I took one capsule of atrantil to see if it was
safe; after verifying that 'll up to 2 doses per day. The presence of
abdominal discomfort these days gives me a clear target of treatment
for Atrantil.

Other symptoms I experienced (for a subset of the time I experienced
abdominal discomfort) include head, neck, and shoulder fatigue and
general fatigue/lethargy. Some of these might have been exacerbated by
the unnatural position and mouth opening that were part of the dental
cleaning process.
