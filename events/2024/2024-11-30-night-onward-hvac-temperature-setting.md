# 2024-11-30 night onward: HVAC temperature-setting

Normally, I've been keeping the temperature-setting of my HVAC system
off. This is because the system doesn't generally work properly
anyway.

Starting the night of 2024-11-30, my protocol is to set the target
indoor temperature at 60 degrees Fahrenheit every night, and turn it
off during the day once the indoor temperature goes above 60 degrees
Fahrenheit. For comparison, with the HVAC temperature-setting off, the
temperature in the early morning has been going down to about 55 to 57
degrees Fahrenheit.

Overnight going from 2024-11-30 to 2024-12-01 as well as overnight
going from 2024-12-01 to 2024-12-02, the temperature seems to have
stayed at around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. It's not totally clear if this
is because the HVAC system is working properly or because it's been
warmer these past couple of days (as it has been warmer during the
daytime so maybe there is just more heat buffer to eat through at
night). Regardless, my sleep quality has been better with the higher
temperature, so I plan to keep this HVAC setting.
