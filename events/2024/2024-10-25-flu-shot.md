## Appointment booking

I booked my appointment for the flu shot on Saturday October 12. The
appointment is for Friday October 25 at 3 PM at the 2801 Adeline
Street location.

I followed the [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
for the process. I also set up all the calendar reminders and executed
on the other preparatory steps as recommended in that document. In
particular, the time of Friday 3 PM was lifted straight from the best
practice (and is also consistent with my choice for the past few
vaccine appointments).

One special consideration I'll call out here is that I did the booking
3 days after my [dental cleaning](2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md),
which was enough time for me to be confident that aftereffects of the
dental cleaning (such as excess salivation or increased sensitivity)
had not materialized. Nonetheless, I maintained the gap of over two
weeks between the dental cleaning and the vaccine appointment, per the
best practice.
