* [Using FoodMarble's Handheld Breath Tester (Aire) in SIBO. A Game
  Changer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBQhUpO3YzQ): This video
  is from August 18, 2022. At this point, the Aire 2 had been
  released, and some of the discussion talks about how the Aire 2
  differs from the original Aire. There's a lot of useful information
  here, including the relationship between their fermentation scores
  and ppm levels. The TL;DW: up to scores of 8, ppm level is 5 times
  the fermentation score. After that the relationship is nonlinear, so
  as to capture the full range of ppm increases for just the 2 points
  from 8 to 10. If hydrogen and methane are separated, this applies to
  each of them individually, allowing for more measurement precision
  for both of them.

  This also shows that at least one clinician seems to use the Aire 2
  regularly for both formal and informal testing. The lack of support
  for hydrogen sulfide is flagged, though.

  SIBO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u50PEdyV8Lw): This is just an
  illustrative example of how somebody uses the FoodMarble Aire
  2. There's no particular insight from it I want to highlight.

* [Doctor D's Review of the Food
  Marble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGp_wAyHTXI): This video
  makes three criticisms of the FoodMarble Aire 2 and of breath
  testing in general:

  * **Variability in transit time between people**, which makes it hard to
    know exactly when the substrate is in the small intestine. People
    with shorter transit times may get false positives because the
    food is already in the large intestine by the 90-minute mark,
    whereas people with longer transit times may get false negatives
    because the food hasn't gone through the small intestine fully.

  * **Interference from previous meals if you don't follow a strict
    prep diet**: Whereas the strict prep diet works for formal
    measurement, the "daily use" aspect of the app can be problematic
    because food from the previous day can still be around in the
    system.

  * **Lack of correlation between the amount of gas produced and the
    severity of symptoms**, particularly for hydrogen (though there
    is some correlation for methane).

* [Well, now I'm confused... **Aire 2 vs. Sibo Lab Test**
  WellnessWednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey4q9P7UVP0):
  This videos goes over the video author's FoodMarble Aire 2 and
  TrioSmart results, highlighting confusion over how they differ in
  the high range. As one of the comments notes, the discrepancy is
  explained by the fact that the "multiplication by 5" breaks down
  above 8.
