# 2024 blood test plans (round 2)

## Test order and appointment

### Order

On 2024-10-31, I placed the test order with Marek Diagnostics for
$222, consistent with the plans outlined below. I received the
requisition form immediately, but as of 2024-11-03, I had not received
guidance on how to interact with LabCorp about it.

### Appointment booking

Rather than waiting for the guidance, I booked an appointment for
Friday 2024-11-22 10:30 AM. The appointment booking process did not
ask for order details, but asked me to confirm that I did have the
order. The reason I booked the appointment rather than wait for Marek
Diagnostics to email me guidance was that appointments need to be
booked 2-3 weeks in advance, and I wanted to snag the slot while it
was available. It is possible to reschedule or cancel the appointment.

## Cost estimate

Cost estimates were based on list prices on ownyourlabs.com,
marekdiagnostics.com, and requestatest.com on 2024-10-14 for most
tests. A few additiona tests were added on 2024-10-21 and prices at
the time were used for the additional tests.

Total cost of tests so far:

* Own Your Labs: $238.71
* Marek Diagnostics: $217 plus $5 phlebotomist fee, totaling to $222
* Request A Test: LabCorp: $390; Quest Diagnostics: $277 not including NMR lipoprofile which is exclusive to LabCorp

From these, Marek Diagnostics worked out to be the winner in terms of
cost, and indeed it did end up costing what I had calculated ($222).

## Test reruns from September 2024

For background, see [2024 blood test plans: Results and
takeaways](../2024/2024-blood-test-plans.md#results-and-takeaways).

### Comprehensive metabolic panel

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/comp-metabolic-panel-14/ ($10)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/collections/lab-builder/products/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-cmp ($10)
* https://requestatest.com/comprehensive-metabolic-panel-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $34)

This is a good test to get done regularly. However, the particular
motivation for doing it just 6-7 months after the previous test is to
confirm that the low BUN level (which was due to temporary diet
changes that reduced protein intake) has been fixed.

I might end up combining this with a CBC with differential; however,
as of the time of writing this, I don't see a compelling reason to get
a CBC with differential just 6-7 months after the previous
one. However, if I have concerning health episodes in the interim, it
may make sense to get one.

### Omega-3: followup measurement to test the success of supplementation and dietary changes

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/omega-check/ ($66)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/omega-check?_pos=1&_sid=072c542f9&_ss=r ($60)
* https://requestatest.com/omega-3-blood-test (LabCorp: $129; Quest Diagnostics: $129)

The goal is to see if the [supplement dosage increase started
2024-09-25](../2024/2024/2024-09-25-decision-to-increase-omega-3-supplement-daily-dose.md) is working well.

## New tests

### NMR lipoprofile with insulin resistance markers: an advanced version of the lipid panel (for a one-time advanced measurement; in the future I expect to return to a regular lipid panel and do the NMR every few years)

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/nmr-lipoprofile-lipids-ir-markers-graph/ ($78.61)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/nmr-lipoprofile%C2%AE-with-lipids-and-insulin-resistance-markers-with-graph?_pos=2&_sid=b3579a4ac&_ss=r ($75)
* https://requestatest.com/nmr-lipoprofile-with-insulin-resistance-markers-test (LabCorp: $119; this test is not available on Quest Diagnostics)

After my September 2024 test, I reduced my olive oil consumption,
added seaweed, and increased my omega-3 dosage. The first of these is
expected to have a direct effect through reducing my saturated fat
levels. Increasing omega-3 dosage may also help.

I'm getting the NMR version as that also includes particle count. I
can also use this particle count to see if the measured apolipoprotein
B is as expected (apolipoprotein in mg/dL should be a little more than
0.054 times the LDL-P measured in nmol/L, because there should be one
apo B per LDL-P, and apo B molecular weight is 540000, so 1 nmol/L is
540000 ng/L = 0.54 mg/L = 0.054 mg/dL. There will be some additional
apo B coming from VLDL and IDL so the apo B should generally be a
little higher than estimated this way).

If this measurement continues to show values in the same range as
September 2024, I plan to devote significant further resources to
learning and trying things to reduce cholesterol.

### Apolipoprotein B

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/apolipoprotein-b/ ($17.20)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/apolipoprotein-b-apob?_pos=1&_sid=17bbc195f&_ss=r ($17)
* https://requestatest.com/apolipoprotein-b-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $65)

Based on recent reading, apolipoprotein B is the mechanism by which
high cholesterol levels increase the risk of atherosclerosis. The
level of apolipoprotein B may therefore be a more direct metric of the
rate of damage. It will be good to measure this. I think it's
important to measure this along with lipid profile, in order to get a
clear correlational picture of the two. In particular, it is expected
that apo B (in mg/dL) is about 0.054 times LDL-P (in nmol/L).

### Lipoprotein a (Lp(a))

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/lipoproteina/ ($35.20)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/lipoproteina-lpa?_pos=1&_psq=lipoprotein&_ss=e&_v=1.0 ($35)
* https://requestatest.com/lipoprotein-a-testing (LabCorp: $55; Quest Diagnostics: $61)

This is a mostly-genetically-determined kind of LDL that does not
respond much to either lifestyle interventions or most of the existing
pharmacological interventions (including statins). I likely just need
to do this test once to get to know if I have a Lp(a) problem, and the
implications can then inform the rest of my decisions. Since it's just
about doing it once and it is not responsive to the kinds of changes I
am likely to make in the next few months, it makes sense to get this
test done sooner rather than later and get that information.

### Thyroid panel

Test details:

* https://ownyourlabs.com/product/thyroid-panel/ ($31.70)
* https://marekdiagnostics.com/products/basic-thyroid-panel-tsh-t4-t3-uptake-free-thyroxine-index?_pos=3&_sid=3089ecb1b&_ss=r ($20)
* https://requestatest.com/thyroid-basic-panel-with-tsh-testing (LabCorp: $49; Quest Diagnostics: $49)

I was tested for TSH back in 2017. It seems reasonable to test thyroid
panel every 4 to 8 years and increase the frequency of testing if
things are potentially concerning. For this round, I'm doing the more
elaborate test rather than only testing TSH, to get a better overall
picture.

## Tests I am not getting this time but considered

* Serum creatine appears to be available on Request A Test at
  https://requestatest.com/creatine-blood-test but not on Own Your Lbs
  or Marek Diagnostics. Both Own Your Lab and Marek Diagnostics do
  have creatine kinase, but this is a different test. (I initially
  confused the two). As my plan for this round is to place the order
  via Marek Diagnostics, I'm planning to skip serum creatine. I may
  potentially do a future round using Request A Test for serum
  creatine, perhaps along with other tests exclusively available via
  Request A Test.

* Testosterone test has many variants. I'd like to have a better
  understanding before proceeding to get this test, so I am skipping
  it from this round.
