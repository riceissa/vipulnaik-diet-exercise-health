# 2024-06-13: slight tingling sensation

Growing over the day, I had a slight tingling sensation suggesting
nervous hypersensitivity, and some markers of abdominal fullness that
were reminiscent of but much milder than my previous abdominal
pain. The sensation was barely noticeable in the morning, and really
became noticeable after my second meal. I suspect it was a side-effect
of overstretching the previous day (though I did get 8 hours of sleep
and was moderately refreshed at the end), some overstimulation in the
morning, overexercising in the mornin, maybe having a bit more food
than I should have in the evening, and maybe keeping food out a bit
longer than usual (though I really doubt that this caused any
issues). It seemed to get a lot better overnight and I ended up
sleeping 9 hours that night.
