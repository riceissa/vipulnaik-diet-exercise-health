# 2024 sleep tracker

This document does not include details of my sleep time, waking-up
time, and sleep duration on a daily basis (I am starting to keep those
details in private logs starting 2024-10-11).

Rather, this document focuses on notable cases, particularly:

* Cases where I slept less than 7 hours or more than 9 hours (as
  measured in the time between when I went to bed and the time I woke
  up, rather than actual sleep time)

* Cases where I had a particularly fitful or interrupted sleep

* Cases where I felt very sleepy and lethargic before my
  1-hour-notice-to-sleep time, outside of known cases of timezone
  adjustment (within the expected timeframe for such adjustment)

* Cases where I went to sleep less than 3 hours after finishing my
  last meal

* Cases where I went to bed more than 30 minute after the target time
  by which I need to get into bed

I plan to start recording starting 2024-10-11. I might also write
separate documents on more complex incidents, but for cases where it's
just a matter of one of the above and does not spill over into other
related issues, I will just note it here.
