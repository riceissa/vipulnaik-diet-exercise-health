# 2024 sleep tracker

This document does not include details of my sleep time, waking-up
time, and sleep duration on a daily basis (I am starting to keep those
details in private logs starting 2024-10-11).

Rather, this document focuses on notable cases, particularly:

* Cases where I slept less than 7 hours or more than 9 hours (as
  measured in the time between when I went to bed and the time I woke
  up, rather than actual sleep time)

* Cases where I had a particularly fitful or interrupted sleep

* Cases where I felt very sleepy and lethargic before my
  1-hour-notice-to-sleep time, outside of known cases of timezone
  adjustment (within the expected timeframe for such adjustment)

* Cases where I went to sleep less than 3 hours after finishing my
  last meal

* Cases where I went to bed more than 30 minute after the target time
  by which I need to get into bed

I plan to start recording starting 2024-10-11. I might also write
separate documents on more complex incidents, but for cases where it's
just a matter of one of the above and does not spill over into other
related issues, I will just note it here.

Ongoing health issues at this time:

### A little bit of lethargy/fatigue after completing second meal and post-meal cleanup

I experienced some degree of lethargy/fatigue after completing my
second meal and post-meal cleanup. This also reflected in
somewhat-lower-than-usual verbal memory scores (63, 55, and 86 points)
at Human Benchmark, as well as lower-than-usual first sequence memory
score (12 points) though my second sequence memory score of 27 points
was high.

A few comments:

* My fatigue level was definitely less pronounced than yesterday, where
  I also felt so overloaded that I didn't even feel like listening to
  music while working.

* I suspect it's partly related to some continued sleep backlog though
  the situation is improve since yesterday.

* I also suspect it's because of bunching a food purchase trip and
  meal prep, which makes for a very long day. This isn't ideal, but it
  ended up being the least bad option due to a bunch of other stuff
  happening earlier in the week.

UPDATE 11 PM: My mood and energy level recovered quite a bit over the
hours, and my verbal memory attempts between 10:30 PM and 11 PM
included my two highest scores so far (216 and 194 respectively).

### A little bit of lethargy/fatigue around 5 PM to 6 PM

I experienced a bit of an energy crash around 5 PM, around 3.5 hours
after the first meal. This likely continues the overall fatigue
pattern of the previous days. Although I did not go out in the
afternoon, I did do a bunch of house cleaning so I was standing and
moving around lightly for about 1.5 hours after eating, which is more
than usual and may have resulted in some of the lethargy.

I did do verbal memory and typing tests and got good scores, so I
don't think the lethargy/fatigue was having the same impact on my
cognition as it had been having yesterday.
