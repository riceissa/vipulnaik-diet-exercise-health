# 2024 sleep tracker

This document does not include details of my sleep time, waking-up
time, and sleep duration on a daily basis (I am starting to keep those
details in private logs starting 2024-10-11).

Rather, this document focuses on notable cases, particularly:

* Cases where I slept less than 7 hours or more than 9 hours (as
  measured in the time between when I went to bed and the time I woke
  up, rather than actual sleep time)

* Cases where I had a particularly fitful or interrupted sleep

* Cases where I felt very sleepy and lethargic before my
  1-hour-notice-to-sleep time, outside of known cases of timezone
  adjustment (within the expected timeframe for such adjustment)

* Cases where I went to sleep less than 3 hours after finishing my
  last meal

* Cases where I went to bed more than 30 minute after the target time
  by which I need to get into bed

I plan to start recording starting 2024-10-11. I might also write
separate documents on more complex incidents, but for cases where it's
just a matter of one of the above and does not spill over into other
related issues, I will just note it here.

## 2024-10-11

Ongoing health issues at this time:
[2024-10-08-onward-abdominal-discomfort-and-other-symptoms.md](2024-10-08-onward-abdominal-discomfort-and-other-symptoms.md). The
relationship with these issues is not clear, but in that document I
have documented the lethargy in that broader context and also
discussed potential overall causal factors.

### A little bit of lethargy/fatigue after completing second meal and post-meal cleanup

I experienced some degree of lethargy/fatigue after completing my
second meal and post-meal cleanup. This also reflected in
somewhat-lower-than-usual verbal memory scores (63, 55, and 86 points)
at Human Benchmark, as well as lower-than-usual first sequence memory
score (12 points) though my second sequence memory score of 27 points
was high.

A few comments:

* My fatigue level was definitely less pronounced than yesterday, where
  I also felt so overloaded that I didn't even feel like listening to
  music while working.

* I suspect it's partly related to some continued sleep backlog though
  the situation is improve since yesterday.

* I also suspect it's because of bunching a food purchase trip and
  meal prep, which makes for a very long day. This isn't ideal, but it
  ended up being the least bad option due to a bunch of other stuff
  happening earlier in the week.

UPDATE 11 PM: My mood and energy level recovered quite a bit over the
hours, and my verbal memory attempts between 10:30 PM and 11 PM
included my two highest scores so far (216 and 194 respectively).

## 2024-10-12

Ongoing health issues at this time:
[2024-10-08-onward-abdominal-discomfort-and-other-symptoms.md](2024-10-08-onward-abdominal-discomfort-and-other-symptoms.md). The
relationship with these issues is not clear, but in that document I
have documented the lethargy in that broader context and also
discussed potential overall causal factors.

### A little bit of lethargy/fatigue around 5 PM to 6 PM

I experienced a bit of an energy crash around 5 PM, around 3.5 hours
after the first meal. This likely continues the overall fatigue
pattern of the previous days. Although I did not go out in the
afternoon, I did do a bunch of house cleaning so I was standing and
moving around lightly for about 1.5 hours after eating, which is more
than usual and may have resulted in some of the lethargy.

I did do verbal memory and typing tests and got good scores, so I
don't think the lethargy/fatigue was having the same impact on my
cognition as it had been having yesterday.

## Week of 2024-10-28 to 2024-11-03

This was a week where my sleep and waking up both shifted a bit to
later, coming right before the end of daylight saving (but not an
intentional move to cope with daylight saving).

There were a few factors:

* Colder mornings, that made it harder to get up, and even after
  getting up, made me delay going to exercise.

* A bunching of personal chores with long time commitments, such as
  cooking, food purchases, and laundry, due to my taking time out from
  those chores in the past weekend right after getting my flu shot.

The culmination was on 2024-11-02 where I did a large laundry load,
and the load size resulted in me needing to do an extra dryer round,
and the cumulative effect of all this was that I ended up finishing my
meal a lot later.

Here's a picture of the time of finishing my second (and last) meal of
the day from Sunday 2024-10-27 to Saturday 2024-11-02:

* 2024-10-27: 6:19 PM (good)
* 2024-10-28: 6:51 PM (good)
* 2024-10-29: 6:35 PM (good)
* 2024-10-30: 8:32 PM (a little late)
* 2024-10-31: 8:26 PM (a little late)
* 2024-11-01: 8:26 PM (a little late)
* 2024-11-02: 10:05 PM (very late)

Here's a picture of the time I went to sleep:

* 2024-10-27 to 2024-10-28: 12:51 AM (a little late)
* 2024-10-28 to 2024-10-29: 11:03 PM (good)
* 2024-10-29 to 2024-10-30: 11:39 PM (good)
* 2024-10-30 to 2024-10-31: 12:58 AM (a little late)
* 2024-10-31 to 2024-11-01: 1:14 AM (quite late)
* 2024-11-01 to 2024-11-02: 12:52 AM (a little late)
* 2024-11-02 to 2024-11-03: 1:37 AM (very late)

Here's a picture of the time I woke up:

* 2024-10-28: 8:44 AM (7 hours 53 minutes of sleep)
* 2024-10-29: 7:49 AM (8 hours 46 minutes of sleep)
* 2024-10-30: 8:10 AM (8 hours 31 minutes of sleep)
* 2024-10-31: 8:56 AM (7 hours 58 minutes of sleep)
* 2024-11-01: 8:04 AM (6 hours 50 minutes of sleep)
* 2024-11-02: 8:51 AM (7 hours 59 minutes of sleep)
* 2024-11-03: 7:32 AM but this would have been 8:32 AM if not for the time shift (6 hours 55 minutes of sleep)

I seem to have averaged about 7 hours 50 minutes of sleep, and on no
day did I go significantly below 7 hours. So, I seem to have got a
reasonable amount of sleep without any day of very low sleep, despite
all the disruption. Hopefully, with the daylight saving switch, and
the end to the bunching of personal chores tasks, I'll be able to
return to a more normal and consistent sleep schedule.

## Sleeping late on 2024-11-21 due to rain-related scheduling issues, rippling through to 2024-11-24

On Thursday 2024-11-21, the rain let up briefly, but it was scheduled
to rain heavily the next day (2024-11-22). So, I decided to do a bunch
of things on 2024-11-21 that I might normally spread out across
days. The effect of this was that I went to sleep pretty late (around
2:26 AM) and this had a ripple effect in terms of shifting my daily
cycle a few hours into the future for the next few days.

On Sunday 2024-11-24, I ended up not being able to have dinner by the
time of my chat with parents, which caused my dinner to be quite late,
therefore hampering my efforts to move my cycle back to a more normal
one.
