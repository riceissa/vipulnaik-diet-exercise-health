# 2024-04-29: eye irritation

On 2024-04-29, shortly after dropping in at the Milvia Urgent Care
facility (and not staying there as they had a long queue for until
their closing time) I experienced some irritation in my right eye. I
was en route to Trader Joe's for grocery shopping, so I finished that
shopping and headed back home. After getting back home, I washed my
eyes with water for a few minutes and the irritation went away after a
little while.

Possible causes of irritation:

* Some dust particle on the journey after exiting Milvia Urgent Care

* Something in Milvia Urgent Care

* Some kind of side-effect of the issues causing my abdominal pain

* (Unlikely) hand sanitizer use prior (there was a bit of splashing
  but I'm pretty sure nothing got in my eye directly).

If I had been able to get in the queue at Milvia Urgent Care, and the
irritation had happened there, I would have needed to use the restroom
to wash my eyes while waiting. I could also in principle have used the
restroom at Trader Joe's, but I chose not to do that because the
irritation didn't feel that serious.
