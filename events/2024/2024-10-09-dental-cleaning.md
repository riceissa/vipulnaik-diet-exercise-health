# 2024-10-09: dental cleaning

## Prior preparation

### Pause to intense and hard foods

* 2024-10-01 (first meal): I had my last sauerkraut before the dental
  cleaning. I had already stopped kimchi for about two weeks due to
  other issues.

* 2024-10-03 (first meal): I had my last round of walnuts before the
  dental cleaning. I only had a small number of walnuts, less than my
  usual serving size, on account of speaking a lot before the meal and
  being delayed with eating my meal.

### Mirror and photos

On 2024-10-07, after picking up a recently purchased intraoral camera
and dental mirror, I examined my back teeth with the dental mirror. I
also took photos of the front and back teeth with the intraoral camera
and saved them into Google Drive and
[GitHub](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health-private/tree/master/self-photos/dental/2024-10-07). The
photos were in this order:

* First I did the back, then the front

* Within each, I did the top (maxillary) first and the bottom (mandibular) later

* Within each, I did left, then middle, then right

A few things I noticed:

* There was clear calculus forming at the joining area between the
  teeth and gums, though it varied a little bit between the teeth. The
  side back teeth seemed worse.

* I could see some black stains on the top back left teeth. This seems
  consistent with what my hygienist had mentioned last time about
  staining, but I hadn't registered that the stains were black. See
  [this

  for some related information.
