# 2024-10-09: dental cleaning

## Prior preparation

### Pause to intense and hard foods

* 2024-10-01 (first meal): I had my last sauerkraut before the dental
  cleaning. I had already stopped kimchi for about two weeks due to
  other issues.

* 2024-10-03 (first meal): I had my last round of walnuts before the
  dental cleaning. I only had a small number of walnuts, less than my
  usual serving size, on account of speaking a lot before the meal and
  being delayed with eating my meal.
