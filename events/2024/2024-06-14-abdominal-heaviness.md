# 2024-06-14: abdominal heaviness

This is likely a continuation of [2024-06-13: slight tingling
sensation](2024-06-13-slight-tingling-sensation.md).

On 2024-06-14, I ate a little late as there were various things to
finish. I also did strength exercises for the first time since my
Portland trip and return; in total, this was after a period of a
little over three weeks.

The tingling sensation from yesterday was quite diminished.

After eating, I experienced some abdominal heaviness, but not pain per
se. The heaviness was more in the upper area, unlike the tingling
sensation that was more in the lower area.

In light of this, I decided for my second meal to start consuming my
vegan probiotic yogurt. After the second meal, I still felt abdominal
heaviness, but it was more pleasant and less strong than after the
first meal.

I think the abdominal heaviness is a continuation of the things
causing the slight tingling sensation. It reflects some kind of
progression and hopefully a recovery. The same likely causes apply;
