# 2024-12-23: Berkeley Hearing Center call

I placed a phone call to the [Berkeley Hearing
Center](https://berkeleyhearing.com/) at 11:40 AM. The call lasted 8
minutes 42 seconds.

## Appointment booking process and questions

### Question about referral

The lady who answered the phone began by asking me how I was
referred. I replied saying that I found the website through a Google
Search.

### Appointment duration and availability

The first available appointment was on Monday 2025-01-13. I asked if
there is an apppointment available on Wednesday 2025-01-15. The
available appointment for Wednesday 2025-01-15 was 3:45 PM to 5 PM. We
went ahead and booked the appointment.

Intake is handled via online forms prior to the appointment so intake
is not part of the appointment process itself. I therefore do not need
to budget additional time for intake.

### Cancellation flexibility

There was no clear guidance regarding cancellation, but I was advised
to try to cancel by the Friday prior to the appointment (2025-01-10)
so that they would be able to offer the appointment to another person.

### Insurance

Berkeley Hearing Center is out-of-network for all insurance except
Medicare, which I don't qualify for. For PPO insurance, my billing
will happen through the insurance but I would still end up having to
pay the entire amount out of pocket. For HMO insurance, I would have
to pay directly at the appointment location using my payment card.

### Cost

The estimated cost was $375 for the best-case scenario where no
serious issues were found and no additional work needs to be done. The
cost could be more if additional work was needed.

### How far in advance they are booked in general

I asked the lady how far in advance they are booked in general. She
said it varies and right now it's a little more because of the
holidays and people booking appointments for after their return.

### Referral to ENT specialist if needed

I got confirmation that as part of the audiological evaluation, they
would make a referral to an ENT specialist if needed.

### Data collection

I was asked to provide my first name, last name, date of birth, phone
number, and email address.

## Online intake questionnaire

Around the time the phone call ended, I received an email message with
a link to an online intake questionnaire under
[counselear.com](https://www.counselear.com/).

I confirmed that the phone number, date of birth, and name were correct.

Here are a few select answers where I entered more text:

> What would you like to achieve from today's visit? Why did you decide to schedule an appointment today?

> On November 29, 2024, I felt a sense of compression in my left ear
> and thought I might have hearing loss there. Tests with my headphone
> have confirmed the hearing loss, which seems to be in the range of
> about 10-20 dB and seems to most affect higher frequencies like 2000
> Hz and 4000 Hz (I used the online test linked at
> https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test). I've been doing
> the tests regularly (every 3-4 days) since December 17, 2024, and
> confirm the persistence of the hearing loss.

> 6. Please describe situations that you have hearing difficulty in:

> The magnitude of my hearing loss is small enough that it hasn't
> become an issue in normal situations. The main inconvenience right
> now is that my headphones don't feel balanced by default when I use
> them -- they feel slightly skewed to the right. Also, stereo music
> doesn't sound exactly as intended because the left side of the music
> feels a little fainter than the right side.

> Additional Comments:

> As a child (around age 4), I had an infection that caused fluid
> buildup and needed operation. I don't currently have medical records
> of the operation. I have not had any obvious hearing issues since
> then until the new issues that started November 29, 2024. I also
> haven't gotten my hearing tested -- either formally or informally --
> as an adult, at least for the past 20 years.

Medical History

> 1. Have you ever experienced a sudden (<24 hours) or rapid (over
> several weeks/months) change in your hearing? Have you noticed that
> your hearing seems to change/fluctuate?

> On November 29, 2024, when I woke up, I felt a sense of compression
> in my left ear and thought I might have hearing loss there.  I
> initially attributed this to earwax buildup due to sleeping too long
> on my left side. Since then, the hearing in my left ear seems to be
> consistently worse than my right ear. There doesn't seem to have
> been much fluctuation with my hearing in either ear since then.

> 3. Do you have ear pressure/ fullness/ the sensation of being underwater?

> Additional Comments:

> Only occasionally, not as a recurring/ongoing thing. I felt this
> most strongly on November 29, 2024, when I woke up and felt I had
> lost hearing in my left ear.

> 7. Do you have a history of ear infections in adulthood? Have you
> experienced discharge from your ear (other than ear wax)?

> Additional Comments:

> I had an ear infection and fluid buildup at around the age of 4 that
> needed operating, but have not had any issues as an adult.

> 8. Have you ever had surgery on your ear(s)? (If YES, please
> explain)

> I had surgery to remove fluid buildup in my ear due to an infection
> as a child (around age 4). I haven't been able to locate detailed
> records yet.

It took me bout 15 minutes (from 11:49 AM to about 12:04 PM) to finish
filling the form. I believe that it was right after I submitted the
form that I got an appointment notification for my appointment,
confirming the date and time that we had determined over the phone.
