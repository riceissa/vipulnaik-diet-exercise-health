# Dental self-exam checklist log

This is the execution log for the [dental self-exam checklist](../checklists/dental-self-exam-checklist.md).

## 2024-10-07

This was my first pass of the checklist, executed right after I picked
up the mirror and intraoral camera and two days prior to my dental
cleaning appointment. I included information on it as part of the
[2024-10-09 dental cleaning
doc](../events/2024/2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md).

## 2024-10-09

This was my second pass of the checklist, executed a few hours after
my dental cleaning appointment.

## 2024-10-29

This was my first periodic execution of the checklist, not tied to a
dental cleaning.

- [ ] Examine teeth in mirror; look for things like stains, plaque, and recession
  - For front teeth, look in the normal mirror, using the hands to pull parts of the mouth to get a better view
  - For back teeth, open mouth wide; use the dental mirror particularly for the back middle teeth and to get an additional angle on the back side teeth (the back side teeth can be partly viewed directly in the mirror if the mouth is wide open)
  - Stain: some distinctive color pattern, usually black, often seen on back side teeth
  - Plaque: "thin, slightly fuzzy, colorless film that might not be readily visible to the naked eye, but you can often feel it with your tongue as a slightly rough texture on your teeth" though in some cases it can show a yellow discoloration
  - Gum recession: gumline is receded from where it should be; the place where it should be is the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and any gap between that and the gumline means the cementum is exposed; this gap area tends to look yellower than the white tooth
- [ ] Using a floss pick, push moderately hard against each interdental gap and confirm that there is no sharp pain, and that the pain recedes quickly once the pressure is removed (the pain should be similar to poking healthy skin and not like poking injured skin)
- [ ] Take photos of front and back teeth using the intraoral camera and save to GitHub in the following order (there should be a total of 12 photos)
  - All back teeth before all front teeth
  - Within each, all upper (maxillary) teeth before all lower (mandibular) teeth
  - Within each, left, then middle, then right
  - The location to save in GitHub should be in the `diet-exercise-health-private` repo in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - Also save in my Google Drive in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- [ ] Compare these photos with the previous photos
