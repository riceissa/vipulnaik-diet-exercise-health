# Vocal note holds (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance

Although I don't talk a lot regularly, I do often need to have long
conversations, some of them at short notice, and being able to talk at
length without going out of breath is helpful.

The exercises here are more designed to help with the acute phase of
it rather than the extended aspect (so more designed to help with
talking quickly for a few minutes versus talking at a more relaxed
pace over a few hours).

My goals are to build toward the following:

* Humming single note hold for at least 25 seconds after normal breathe out

* Oral single note hold for at least 30 seconds after normal breathe out

* Humming tune for at least 15 seconds after normal breathe out

* Oral tune for at least 20 seconds after normal breathe out

## Current protocol and status as of 2024-09-22

I did some test runs of the exercise, but plan to integrate them into
my morning exercise routine, alternating with the days I do breath
holds. There are four exercises I have in mind. I should take breaks
of at least 30 seconds between exercises.

### Drink water before and after exercise

If my mouth is dry, that can pose a barrier to sustaining notes, so
drink water and make sure I've swallowed it before starting.

It's also a good idea to sip a little water after the exercise.

### Humming single note hold after a normal breathe out

Here, I do a normal breathe in and out through my nose, then hum a
single note for as long as I can. My current expectation is that I can
do about 10-20 seconds. In general, I expect my humming note
hold duration to be about 15-30% of my breath hold duration, so I
expect that both will go up together over time.

### Oral single note hold after a normal breathe out

Here, I do a normal breathe in and out through my nose, then vocalize
a single note (with mouth). Currently, my expectation is that I can
hold a single note for about 15-20 seconds, but there could be a lot
of variation between tries.

### Humming tune after a normal breathe out

Here, I do a normal breathe out and then hum a tune. The tune is about
20 seconds long but I can loop back if I still can go on.

### Oral tune after a normal breathe out

Here, I do a normal breathe out and then vocalize a tune (with
mouth). The tune is about 20 seconds long but I can loop back if I
still can go on.
