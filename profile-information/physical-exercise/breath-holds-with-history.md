# Breath holds (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Hypoxia training / hypoventilation training / Buteyko whatever

Having a long duration of breath hold is helpful for a variety of
purposes.

It means that the body is capable of surviving and carrying out bodily
functions even without incoming oxygen, and while having a buildup of
carbon dioxide.

This can be relevant for various things:

* Talking/singing: As these activities use energy while also
  preventing breathing in, a long duration of breath hold helps with
  being able to talk and sing for longer, particularly long,
  continuous stretches. Talking in particular is an activity that,
  although I don't engage in it often, I might need to engage in for
  continuous stretches.  Not feeling out of breath when talking, and
  not having to take audible breaths when talking, is helpful.

* Physically intensive activity: While breathing in is not stopped as
  part of cardio exercise, the body may have periods where it needs
  more oxygen than it can get, or is producing more carbon dioxide
  than it can be release. Being able to sustain these brief periods,
  ideally while continuing to breathe nasally, is helpful.

* Dealing with natural situations of reduced oxygen such as nasal
  congestion, poor air quality, or mask use: Long breath holds may
  help me not feel out of breath in these situations.

There are other situations I don't anticipate being in, such as
swimming, where this also helps.

### The right target threshold

My current target threshold that I'm hoping to build toward is around
70 to 90 seconds. Currently (as of 2025-02-09) my range is 55 to 90
seconds, with most measures being 60 to 85 seconds. Once I hit the
range of 70 to 90 seconds, I'll feel satisfied and will probably not
be pushing to improve (though I might experience continued
improvement).

However, as of 2024-11-30, I am pausing efforts to aggressively build
toward the target threshold, by reducing my exercise frequency to
every 4 days (further reduced to once every 6 days on
2024-12-06). This is a trade-off for time (and keeping in mind that
winter tends to have a higher load of work related to cooking, food
purchases, eating, and cleaning, so I am more pressed for time). I may
return to a more aggressive build mode in the future.

## Current protocol and status as of 2025-02-09

I do two successive breath holds in the morning, with a gap of about 1
to 2 minutes in between. Each breath hold generally lasts between 55
and 90 seconds, with most breath holds lasting between 60 and 85
seconds. My goal is that after the end of the breath hold, I may have
a few loud nasal breaths but should not generally need a mouth breath.

My plan is to do this exercise once every 6 days, with the idea being
to only do it on days that I am *not* planning to do weight-lifting,
push-ups, pull-ups, or dead hang, and to do it on alternate days of
this nature. The exercise I'm alternating this with is [humming with
intermittent
pauses](humming-with-intermittent-pauses-with-history.md).

## 2023-07-30: initial exploration

At the suggestion of my friend Issa Rice, who in turn had heard about
it from Mark Lippmann, suggested I try some Buteyko breathing
measurements and exercises and report my results to him. Issa Rice
would go on to write a [breathing
document](https://riceissa.github.io/breathing/) that is a great read.

### Control pause measurement from Howard Cooper

I tried the [control pause measurement as suggested by Howard
Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98&t=593s) at Issa's
suggestion. Or more specifically, I tried to first measure my control
pause: the duation for which I can comfortably hold my breath by
pinching my nose. In Cooper's language, "how long till you get a
definite urge to breathe". Howard Cooper also suggested doing multiple
iterations of holding the nose for *half* the control pause (the
duration just measured), after identifying the measured duration.

I wasn't exactly sure of the criterion for "definite urge to breathe",
but the physiological sense I got when I stopped was that my nostrils
were pushing at the fingers I was using to hold my nose. After 2-3
seconds of continuous pushing, I released my nose.

The measurements I got were in the range of 20 to 28 seconds.

After doing the exercise, I also watched the rest of the video
(including the earlier portion).

## Many small breath holds exercise from Neil Tranter

Also at Issa's suggestion, I tried the [guided many small breath holds
exercise by Neil
Tranter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZL0llp5Ac&t=388s). This
involves multiple iterations of holding the nose (for about 3-5
seconds) and regular breathing (for about 15-20 seconds). I did the
exercise along with the video, and did not need any rescue breaths. I
probably held my nose a little bit longer than the guidance in the
exercise due to some delay in responding.

Note that Tranter's suggested exercise is similar to Cooper's
suggested exercise, except that the duration for holding the nose is
set to 3-5 seconds rather than using half of the control
pause. However, whereas in the Cooper video I was focused primarily on
the control pause measurement, in the Tranter case I was focused on
execution of the actual exercise.

After doing the exercise, I also watched the rest of the video
(including the earlier portion).

## 2024-05-16 update

As of 2024-05-16 (and continuing on from there), I have settled into
a routine of doing two max-pause breath holds in succession. I
generally do them in the morning (no food for 12 hours or more) or in
the evening before going jogging; this is generally at least two hours
after a meal). The process is as follows:

* I do a normal expiration (exhalation) and then immediately cover my
  nostrils wit my fingers (using face tissues so that my fingers
  aren't directly touching my nose) to hold my breath.

* I then keep my nostrils closed for as long as I can get myself
  to. This generally ranges from 40 seconds to 60 seconds.

* After I release my nostrils, I generally wait about a minute for my
  breathing to return to normal, then repeat the exercise. The second
  iteration generally has a similar duration as the first, of about 40
  to 60 seconds.

What else I do during the breath hold can vary:

* Sometimes I just close my eyes and relax. All else equal, my breath
  hold duration is a little higher in these cases. I've even in some
  cases managed max-pause breath holds of 65 seconds by relaxing with
  my eyes closed for most of the duration.

* At the other extreme, in other cases, I try one of the exercises
  from [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/) that can be
  executed with a single hand. My favorites are [sequence
  memory](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/sequence) and [verbal
  memory](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/verbal-memory), both of
  which can be easily played with a single hand. I've generally
  noticed my rate of errors for these exercise to be higher toward the
  end of the breath hold, reflecting my (temporary) cognitive
  deterioration.

Sensations I notice during the breath hold:

* The first 20 seconds feel fairly normal, though a little
  uncomfortable.

* Somewhere between 20 seconds and 30 seconds, I sometimes feel
  something going on with my eardrums, for instance, it getting
  compressed the way it would if I pressed my ears.

* Past 30 seconds, I start feeling some tingly sensations and
  discomfort, where I'm definitely exerting willpower to keep my
  nostrils closed.

* Past 40 seconds, I start feeling restless, and it is at around this
  time that I might start developing stronger aches in some
  areas. Areas with recurrent minor aches tend to ache much more
  significantly at this time. For instance, when I have generalized
  abdominal discomfort, I notice pain in the abdominal area go up
  quite a bit around this time.

* Previously, I used to experience a sensation of the nostrils pushing
  out on my fingers, but of late I have not experienced this sensation
  often (though it does happen occasionally).

Sensations I notice right after finishing the breath hold:

* I generally have an audible breathing out and breathing in right
  after the release. However, on most days I still continue to breathe
  nasally rather than having to open my mouth. In the past, it was
  more common for me to take one mouth breath right after finishing a
  max-pause breath hold.

* I may feel a little out of sorts for about 2-3 minutes after the
  second breath hold. If I am feeling generally unwell, the
  out-of-sorts feeling may continue longer (like 5-10 minutes).

## 2024-09-12 update

My practice has mostly stayed the same as described in the 2024-05-16
update. However, my average duration of breath hold has now increased
a bit. Whereas previously it was about 40 to 60 seconds, my range is
now around 45 to 72 seconds. Generally, the high end of the range is
achieved when I am not trying to do any cognitively intense tasks
during the breath hold.

## 2024-09-22 update

From this time onward, my plan is to do this practice on alternate
days instead of daily, so that on the other alternate days I can do
practice of [vocal note holds](vocal-note-holds-with-history.md).

## 2024-10-08 update (edited 2024-10-14)

My practice has mostly stayed the same as described in the 2024-05-16
update. However, my average duration of breath hold has now increased
a bit. Whereas previously it was about 45 to 72 seconds, my range is
now around 50 to 80 seconds. My control pause feels like it's about
half my max pause, which is roughly consistent with what the Buteyko
subreddit says, so my control pause is likely around 25 to 40
seconds. However, control pause is much harder to measure than max
pause, which is why I am sticking with max pause measurement.

## 2024-11-30 update (effective 2024-12-01)

Going forward, my plan is to do this exercise once every 4 days rather
than once every 2 days, with the idea being to only do it on days that
I am *not* planning to do weight-lifting and push-ups, and to do it on
alternate days of this nature. Here are a few thoughts on this:

* I expect that reducing the frequency to once every 4 days will make
  it more of a "maintain" than a "build" exercise for the time
  being. If I see my max-pause maintained, I will be happy to keep
  this frequency for the time being. If I see my max-pause go down,
  though, I may need to return to the frequency of once every 2 days.

* By doing this only on days that I am not doing weight-lifting and
  push-ups, I am trying to balance out the exercise time between
  days. Generally, days that I do weight-lifting and push-ups tend to
  be days that I spend more time exercising, so saving time on those
  days by skipping breath holds can help. More balance between days in
  the time I spend exercising is helpful in terms of keeping my times
  for other daily activities (such as eating) consistent.

* The motivation for this change is partly the nature of winter: as I
  spend more energy staying warm, I have more of an appetite, which
  increases my time spent eating, cooking, buying food, and cleaning
  dishes. This puts more pressure on the rest of my time. My thinking
  as of now is that moving to a "maintain" mode during these months of
  greater time scarcity, at least for exercises where I am already at
  a reasonable level, makes sense. I can re-evaluate the situation in
  the summer; I expect to have some time freed up from reducing
  food-related work, *but* I don't yet know how I will want to direct
  that freed-up time.

## 2024-12-06 update

I am reducing the frequency of this exercise from once every 4 days to
once every 6 days; now I only do this exercise on days when I am not
doing either weight-lifting + push-ups or dead hang + pull-ups. This
accompanies an overall reduction in the frequency of those strength
exercises.

## 2025-02-09 update

I have increased the ranges of durations of breath holds as follows,
reflecting recent improvements:

* Duration range: (50 to 80 seconds) to (55 to 90 seconds)
* Typical duration range: (55 to 70 seconds) to (60 to 85 seconds)
