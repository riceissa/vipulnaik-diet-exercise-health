# Breath holds (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Hypoxia training / hypoventilation training / Buteyko whatever

Having a long duration of breath hold is helpful for a variety of
purposes.

It means that the body is capable of surviving and carrying out bodily
functions even without incoming oxygen, and while having a buildup of
carbon dioxide.

This can be relevant for various things:

* Talking/singing: As these activities use energy while also
  preventing breathing in, a long duration of breath hold helps with
  being able to talk and sing for longer, particularly long,
  continuous stretches. Talking in particular is an activity that,
  although I don't engage in it often, I might need to engage in for
  continuous stretches.  Not feeling out of breath when talking, and
  not having to take audible breaths when talking, is helpful.

* Physically intensive activity: While breathing in is not stopped as
  part of cardio exercise, the body may have periods where it needs
  more oxygen than it can get, or is producing more carbon dioxide
  than it can be release. Being able to sustain these brief periods,
  ideally while continuing to breathe nasally, is helpful.

* Dealing with natural situations of reduced oxygen such as nasal
  congestion, poor air quality, or mask use: Long breath holds may
  help me not feel out of breath in these situations.

There are other situations I don't anticipate being in, such as
swimming, where this also helps.

### The right target threshold

My current target threshold that I'm hoping to build toward is around
65 to 80 seconds. Currently (as of 2024-09-22) my range is 45 to 72
seconds, with most measures being 50 to 65 seconds. At the range of 65
to 80 seconds, the corresponding effects on the downstream functional
effects I care about will be strong enough that it won't really be a
bottleneck any more.

## Current protocol and status as of 2024-09-22

I do two successive breath holds in the morning, with a gap of about a
minute in between. Each breath hold generally lasts between 45 and 72
seconds. My goal is that after the end of the breath hold, I may have
a few loud nasal breaths but should not generally need a mouth breath.

Starting 2024-09-22, my plan is to do this on alternate days instead
of every day, so that the other day I can work on [humming with
intermittent
pauses](humming-with-intermittent-pauses-with-history.md).

## 2023-07-30: initial exploration

At the suggestion of my friend Issa Rice, who in turn had heard about
it from Mark Lippmann, suggested I try some Buteyko breathing
measurements and exercises and report my results to him. Issa Rice
would go on to write a [breathing
document](https://riceissa.github.io/breathing/) that is a great read.

### Control pause measurement from Howard Cooper

I tried the [control pause measurement as suggested by Howard
Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XliOGg8Tl98&t=593s) at Issa's
suggestion. Or more specifically, I tried to first measure my control
pause: the duation for which I can comfortably hold my breath by
pinching my nose. In Cooper's language, "how long till you get a
definite urge to breathe". Howard Cooper also suggested doing multiple
iterations of holding the nose for *half* the control pause (the
duration just measured), after identifying the measured duration.

I wasn't exactly sure of the criterion for "definite urge to breathe",
but the physiological sense I got when I stopped was that my nostrils
were pushing at the fingers I was using to hold my nose. After 2-3
seconds of continuous pushing, I released my nose.

The measurements I got were in the range of 20 to 28 seconds.

After doing the exercise, I also watched the rest of the video
(including the earlier portion).

## Many small breath holds exercise from Neil Tranter

Also at Issa's suggestion, I tried the [guided many small breath holds
exercise by Neil
Tranter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZL0llp5Ac&t=388s). This
involves multiple iterations of holding the nose (for about 3-5
seconds) and regular breathing (for about 15-20 seconds). I did the
exercise along with the video, and did not need any rescue breaths. I
probably held my nose a little bit longer than the guidance in the
exercise due to some delay in responding.

Note that Tranter's suggested exercise is similar to Cooper's
suggested exercise, except that the duration for holding the nose is
set to 3-5 seconds rather than using half of the control
pause. However, whereas in the Cooper video I was focused primarily on
the control pause measurement, in the Tranter case I was focused on
execution of the actual exercise.

After doing the exercise, I also watched the rest of the video
(including the earlier portion).

## 2024-05-16 update

As of 2024-05-16 (and continuing on from there), I have settled into
a routine of doing two max-pause breath holds in succession. I
generally do them in the morning (no food for 12 hours or more) or in
the evening before going jogging; this is generally at least two hours
after a meal). The process is as follows:

* I do a normal expiration (exhalation) and then immediately cover my
  nostrils wit my fingers (using face tissues so that my fingers
  aren't directly touching my nose) to hold my breath.

* I then keep my nostrils closed for as long as I can get myself
  to. This generally ranges from 40 seconds to 60 seconds.

* After I release my nostrils, I generally wait about a minute for my
  breathing to return to normal, then repeat the exercise. The second
  iteration generally has a similar duration as the first, of about 40
  to 60 seconds.

What else I do during the breath hold can vary:

* Sometimes I just close my eyes and relax. All else equal, my breath
  hold duration is a little higher in these cases. I've even in some
  cases managed max-pause breath holds of 65 seconds by relaxing with
  my eyes closed for most of the duration.

* At the other extreme, in other cases, I try one of the exercises
  from [Human Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/) that can be
  executed with a single hand. My favorites are [sequence
  memory](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/sequence) and [verbal
  memory](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/verbal-memory), both of
  which can be easily played with a single hand. I've generally
  noticed my rate of errors for these exercise to be higher toward the
  end of the breath hold, reflecting my (temporary) cognitive
  deterioration.

Sensations I notice during the breath hold:

* The first 20 seconds feel fairly normal, though a little
  uncomfortable.

* Somewhere between 20 seconds and 30 seconds, I sometimes feel
  something going on with my eardrums, for instance, it getting
  compressed the way it would if I pressed my ears.

* Past 30 seconds, I start feeling some tingly sensations and
  discomfort, where I'm definitely exerting willpower to keep my
  nostrils closed.

* Past 40 seconds, I start feeling restless, and it is at around this
  time that I might start developing stronger aches in some
  areas. Areas with recurrent minor aches tend to ache much more
  significantly at this time. For instance, when I have generalized
  abdominal discomfort, I notice pain in the abdominal area go up
  quite a bit around this time.

* Previously, I used to experience a sensation of the nostrils pushing
  out on my fingers, but of late I have not experienced this sensation
  often (though it does happen occasionally).

Sensations I notice right after finishing the breath hold:

* I generally have an audible breathing out and breathing in right
  after the release. However, on most days I still continue to breathe
  nasally rather than having to open my mouth. In the past, it was
  more common for me to take one mouth breath right after finishing a
  max-pause breath hold.

* I may feel a little out of sorts for about 2-3 minutes after the
  second breath hold. If I am feeling generally unwell, the
  out-of-sorts feeling may continue longer (like 5-10 minutes).

## 2024-09-12 update

My practice has mostly stayed the same as described in the 2024-05-16
update. However, my average duration of breath hold has now increased
a bit. Whereas previously it was about 40 to 60 seconds, my range is
now around 45 to 72 seconds. Generally, the high end of the range is
achieved when I am not trying to do any cognitively intense tasks
during the breath hold.

## 2024-09-22 update

From this time onward, my plan is to do this practice on alternate
days instead of daily, so that on the other alternate days I can do
practice of [vocal note holds](vocal-note-holds-with-history.md).

## 2024-10-08 update

My practice has mostly stayed the same as described in the 2024-05-16
update. However, my average duration of breath hold has now increased
a bit. Whereas previously it was about 45 to 72 seconds, my range is
now around 53 to 80 seconds. However, my "control pause" doesn't feel
like it has improved much, still being in the 30-40 second range. It
seems like most of the improvement seems to be from being better able
to continue the breath hold after I don't feel like continuing it,
rather than an increase in the control pause itself. This also seems
to be true for intra-day and intra-hold variation: the holds where I
feel like giving up early can often be longer than the holds where I
don't feel like giving up until a bit later. Basically, it feels like
the control pause and max-pause are not very tightly coupled. However,
this is a bit hard to quantify, so my impression may be mistaken.
