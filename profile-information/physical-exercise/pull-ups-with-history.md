# Pull-ups (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Build towards being able to do 5 underhand and 5 overhand pull-ups when doing the exercise after dead hang

The goal of pull-ups is to improve upper body strength, particularly
arm and hand strength. It complements the [dead
hang](dead-hang-with-history.md). My goal is to do the pull-ups after
the dead hang exercises.

## Current protocol

After finishing the underhand and overhand dead hang, I should do the
underhand and overhand pull-ups. The order betwen underhand and
overhand doesn't matter. Within each, I should do the pull-ups in
series (i.e., the count measures the number of pull-ups I do in
succession while hanging).

Currently, when it's done after the dead hang, I can do about 2-3
underhand and 2-3 overhand.

## History

### 2024-11-14

I started doing pull-ups regularly (once evert 2-3 days, after dead
hang) on 2024-11-14.
