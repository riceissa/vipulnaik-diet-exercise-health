# Weight-lifting exercises (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Build toward being able to do all exercises on 10 lb in each hand and some exercises at higher weights

Weight-lifting exercises are super-important as being able to carry, hold,
and move things around can be relevant for day-to-day and one-off
real-world situations.

From a day-to-day perspective, carrying grocery bags home has become
much more effortless as I've ramped up weight-lifting exercises, and I
attribute the success here to weight-lifting exercises (and maybe some hand
gripper exercise).

For unusual situations, things like moving furniture or heavy
equipment around, pushing a jammed door, etc. are all use cases where
I feel like I don't yet have the strength that could reasonably be
expected to do these, which means I may be stuck in situations or have
to rely on external help for tasks that don't actually need multiple
people.

Building the associated muscle can also be helpful for being able to
better handle sudden impact injuries, though for the most part I
should not be using that mechanism (I should just avoid getting
injured).

## Current protocol

### Frequency: 2 to 3 days

I generally do weight-lifting exercises about once every 2-3 days when
well. The gap is variable between 2 and 3 days, allowing me a bit of
flexibility in terms of time availability, fatigue levels, and other
strength-using stuff during the day (such as shopping).

### Warmup

I always start weight-lifting exercises after returning from jogging (within
about 20 minutes of returning). Also, right before starting, I do
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises. The goal of these is
to confirm that my balance is fine -- if there are issues with my
balance, this could increase the risk of injury during strength
exercises.

### Weightlifting

I do my weightlifting exercises while standing on an exercise
mat. This is to reduce the risk of injury from any fall due to loss of
balance.

I have two exercises, that I'll call exercise 1 and exercise 2 for
now.

I have pairs of weights of 2 lb each, 3 lb each, 5 lb each, and 8 lb
each. I don't use the 2 lb pair any more for my regular exercise. Here
is my sequence:

* 3 lb pair, exercise 1: about 15 repetitions

* 3 lb pair, exercise 2: about 15 repetitions

* 5 lb pair, exercise 1: about 15 repetitions

* 5 lb pair, exercise 2: about 15 repetitions

* 8 lb pair, exercise 1: about 15 repetitions

* 8 lb pair, exercise 2: about 10 repetitions; this is the exercise
  where I am currently reaching my peak number of repetitions before
  getting fatigued

The reason I always start with the 3 lb is for a mix of warmup and
verification purposes. If, on a given day, I find that the 3 lb pair
is fatiguing me or I am having trouble with it, I can pause the
weightlifting before proceeding to a higher weight where there is more
risk of injury.

After finishing weights, I do push-ups documented at [push-ups (with
history)](push-ups-with-history.md).

### Gap to meal

I generally try to wait at least 30 minutes between the finishing of
weight-lifting exercises and my next meal, following
[this](2021-01-10-ben-greenfield-hormesis.md), though I do try to
drink water immediately upon completion of the weight-lifting exercises.

### Reasons for skipping

Since I do weight-lifting exercises after returning from jogging, any of the
reasons for skipping jogging also lead to skipping strength
exercises. However, since the frequency of weight-lifting exercises is once
every 2-3 days, with variability in whether I do 2 or 3 days, I may
skip jogging on one day without effectively skipping strength
exercises.

In addition, I may skip weight-lifting exercises for these reasons:

* **Post-jogging fatigue or hunger**: In some cases, I am feeling fine
  before I start jogging, but jogging fatigues me or gets me to a
  state of hunger where I don't want to create a further delay to
  eating by doing weights.

* **Muscle aches or abdominal discomfort**: Even beyond a clear
  sickness, if I am feeing any kind of aches or strain on the muscles
  that I expect to use heavily during weight-lifting exercises, I skip the
  weight-lifting exercises.

* **Pre- and post-break for vaccination**: For vaccination (or any
  other injection into the muscle) I have a pre-break of three days
  and a post-break of one week for weight-lifting exercises. For blood
  draws, I have a pre-break of one day and a post-break of three days
  for weight-lifting exercises.

* **Finger injury that gets in the way of gripping**: This can get in
  othe way of weights as well as pushups.

## History

I have done weight-lifting exercises off and on, but mostly off, till about
2021. In November 2021, I started doing weight-lifting exercises regularly
in November 2021 and have ramped them up slowly since then.

## 2021-11-02: starting my steady weight-lifting exercise journey

On Tuesday, November 2, 2021, I received my order of weights. The
previous day I had received my exercise mat order.

Starting on Tuesday, I began alternating-day weightlifting, push-ups
and stretching exercises.

I had already been doing stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises
reasonably regularly; I resolved to do these as part of my
alternate-day practice, though I might also do it on the other days
when I wasn't doing weightlifting.

All my weight-lifting and stretching exercises are done while on the
exercise mat; the stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed I may do while on
and off the exercise mat (stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed is harder
on a mat because of the less stable surface of the mat).

I'm starting with 2 lb weights and will progress to 3 lb after a few
weeks.

### Updates in the next few months

* In December 2021, I switched from just doing 2 lb to doing both 2 lb
  and 3 lb.

* In March 2022, I switched from doing 2 lb and 3 lb to doing 3 lb and
  5 lb.

### 2023-11-01: weight-lifting weight increase

On Wednesday, November 1, 2023, I bought an 8 lb dumb bell (single
piece) from Walgreens as part of a trip to the store. My goal is to do
simpler exercises with the 8 lb dumb bell while continuing to do the
harder exercises with 3 lb and 5 lb dumb bells.

### 2024-01-21: weight-lifting weight increase

On Friday 2024-01-12, when I went to Walgreens for my COVID vaccine, I bought
a 8 lb dumb bell on the way back; I already had one other 8 lb dumb
bell, so this was my second such dumb bell, allowing for simultaneous
exercise with 8 lb in both hands. However, since I had just received
the vaccine, I took a break from weight-lifting exercises for a few days.

On Sunday 2024-01-21, as part of resumed weight-lifting exercises, I
exercised with 8 lb dumb bells in both hands for the first time. For
my exercise sequence, I started with the 3 lb dumb bells, then
proceeded to do the same exercises on the 5 lb dumb bells, and finally
did the 8 lb dumb bells. For the 8 lb dumb bells, I could notice that
I was having more trouble completing the full number of repetitions
(15) for one of the exercises, so I called it off at 10, and even for
those 10 I broke it down into parts with a few seconds of rest in
between.

Later in the day, toward the end of my walking return journey from a
shopping trip, I experienced pain in my right shoulder. I was carrying
grocery bags in both hands, and also had a backpack on; the weight of
the bag in my right hand had been a little higher than the weight of
the bag in my left hand for most of the journey. To address this, I
moved both bags to my left hand for a little while, and also moved the
bagpack strap off my right shoulder so that it loosely rested on my
upper right arm. After a little while, I transferred the lighter bag
to my right hand but kept the strap off my right shoulder until I
could get back home and take it all off.
