# Dead hang (with history)

Reference article: https://www.dmoose.com/blogs/training/what-is-a-dead-hang

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Build towards being able to go both underhand and overhand for at least 1 minute

A dead hang is a good way to improve the strength of my arms and
shoulders, while continuing to reinforce hand grip. It also helps with
balance and flexibility.

This will help me be able to carry and move heavier loads while also
stay balanced in more complex movements.

There is significant overlap in goals with [strength
exercises](strength-exercises-with-history.md).

## Current practice

Generally, I do this after returning from jogging.

* Underhand dead hang (palms facing me) for as long as I can; as of
  2024-10-04, this is appromximately 30-35 seconds.

* Overhand dead hang (palms away from me) for as long as I can; as of
  2024-10-06, this is about 45-50 seconds.

From 2024-12-06 onward, I aim to do this once every 3 days, and more
specifically on the days after my strength exercise break and the day
before I do weight-lifting exercises. Previously I did the exercise on
alternating days, alternating with weight-lifting.

## 2024-10-02 onward: started underhand dead hang

On 2024-10-02, I started the underhand dead hang. To do this, I check
the time on my laptop, go to the dead hang bar, hang from it till I
can, then get off and check the time. The process of going from my
laptop to the bar and back takes 5-10 seconds, and the overall clocked
time is about 40-45 seconds, so my estimate of time with the dead hang
is about 30-35 seconds.

## 2024-10-06 onward: introducing overhand dead hang as well

Starting 2024-10-06, I introduced the overhand dead and got an
estimate of about 45-50 seconds.
