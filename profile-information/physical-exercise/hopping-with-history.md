# Hopping (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance

Hopping is a more dynamic counterpart to [standing on one leg with
eyes closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md). It
shares some of the same functional relevance.

### Functional relevance

Hopping is relevant for:

* Increasing leg and knee strength

* Improving the dynamic aspects of balance (similar to how standing on
  one leg with eyes closed improves the static aspects of balance)

### Goal is to be able to hop a short distance including direction changes

As of now, my goal is to be able to hop a short distance (about 20
feet, and at least 15 hops) within my house, without losing balance,
and including changes to direction.

## Current protocol and status as of 2024-11-17

Everyday, for some real-world movement within the house, such as going
to the restroom, I will hop. I should do at least one hop on each
leg. The goal with each iteration of hopping should be to do a hop
sequence of at least 15 hops with at least one direction change.
