# Deliberate falling practice (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance

The goal of this practice is to maintain and verify my ability to fall
the "right" way, using large surface areas to reduce the pressure at
impact, and reduce the risk of hurting joints. The reason this is
important is that accidental falls continue to be a risk.

The verification is both that I use the correct way of falling, and
that my level of apparent physical injury and perceived mental injury
is low enough. That not only verifies the correctness of my method of
falling, but also provides weak evidence of bone, muscle, joint, and
skin health.

## Current practice

* Weekly catch-myself-before-falling exercise, where my goal is to
  simulate tripping while leaning very far forward, and yet catch
  myself.

* Weekly fall-forward onto exercise mat, with my arm on my side,
  clasped together, or behind my back (so that they are not "ready" to
  be in the correct position). This not only tests that I remember the
  correct way of falling on my forearms, but also checks that I can
  quickly move my arms into correct position even as I am falling
  down.

Things to check after:

* Process: I should take the impact on my forearms and maybe my knees.

* Results: I should have no physical pain, no visible injury, and no
  deterioration of strength/function for the strength exercises I do
  immediately afterward.

## 2024-10-05: initiation of falling forward exercise

The weekly exercise should be done
when I already have the exercise mat out for other exercises. It
should be done on Friday or a weekend assuming no immediate need to go
out and present myself for the next 2-3 days (so that if I do injure
myself, I can recover.

* (First planned iteration next weekend) Weekly
  catch-myself-before-falling exercise, where my goal is to simulate
  tripping while leaning very far forward, and yet catch myself.

* (First iteration 2024-09-29, a few days before formally instituting
  the practice) Weekly fall-forward onto exercise mat, with my arm on
  my side, clasped together, or behind my back (so that they are not
  "ready" to be in the correct position). This not only tests that I
  remember the correct way of falling on my forearms, but also checks
  that I can quickly move my arms into correct position even as I am
  falling down.

Things to check after:

* Process: I should take the impact on my forearms and maybe my knees.

* Results: I should have no physical pain, no visible injury, and no
  deterioration of strength/function for the strength exercises I do
  immediately afterward.
