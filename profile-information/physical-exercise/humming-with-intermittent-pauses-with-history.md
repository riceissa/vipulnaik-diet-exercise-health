# Humming with intermittent pauses (with history)

See also [vocal note holds with history](vocal-note-holds-with-history.md).

## Goal and functional relevance

Although I don't talk a lot regularly, I do often need to have long
conversations, some of them at short notice, and being able to talk at
length without going out of breath is helpful.

This exercise is designed for a context of talking for several minutes
while taking only short pauses to catch my breath. Unlike vocal note
holds, the goal isn't to have a long note with no pause, but to be
able to cycle between vocal cord use and breathing in in a sustainable
fashion over a period of minutes.

## Current protocol as of 2024-11-16

The protocol is that I hum a tune continuously except specific beats
(e.g., 1 in every 8 beats) and I use that specific beat to pause my
hum and take a nasal inbreath.

There are three parameters here:

* The fraction of beats where I take an inbreath

* The duration of the inbreath (from which, along with the preceding
  information, the duration of the hum can be inferred)

* How long I can sustain this pattern

For training, I am using these songs:

* [Chennai Express theme
  song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6KtEqxGQbw) which is in a
  regular 4/4 meter so I can use powers of 2 easily, with roughly 8
  beats every 4.5 seconds, or each beat is about 562 ms.

I might also use these songs in the future:

* [No More War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ADnsqiqAI8)

* [Official Game of Thrones Opening
  Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7L2PVdrb_8) (this is in
  triple meter and is also trickier because the song has more of a
  progression, but I can just hum the main refrain)

For the Chennai Express theme song, my current observations are as follows:

* I can do the 1 in 32 beats for about 1 round but may feel out of
  breath and miss additional beats toward the end. I can then follow
  it up with 1 in 16 beats for one additional round. **This is my
  default.**

* I can do the 1 in 16 beats for a few rounds of the song
  comfortably.

* When jogging, right at the start of jogging, I can manage 1 in 8
  beats, but after a few minutes, I can only manage 1 in 4 (or even 2
  in 4) beats.

The plan is to do all the above listed bullet point exercises at least
every alternate day as part of regular routine, and then a few times
additionally if I get a chance. At some point, I may be able to drop
the 1 in 8 and proceed to 1 in 16 and 1 in 32 exercises.

## History

### Introduction on 2024-09-28

When I started this exercise on 2024-09-28, I was able to comfortably
do 1 in 8 and I could do 1 in 16 but with some fatigue.

#### Update on 2024-11-16

On 2024-11-16, based on progress, I've upped the expectation to
comfortable do 1 in 16 and to be able to do 1 in 32 for almost one
round.
