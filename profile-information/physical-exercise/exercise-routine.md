Last major update: September 23, 2023

Last pass of full document review (with updates and corrections where needed): May 17, 2024

This document describes my exercise routine. I intend to update it
when there are changes to my ongoing routine. See also my yearly
exercise tracker docs (such as
[2023-exercise-tracker.md](2023-exercise-tracker.md) and
[2024-exercise-tracker.md](2024-exercise-tracker.md)) where I record
time periods where I deviated from the routine.

## Jogging and return walking

I jog daily for about 1.4 miles and walk the remainder of the 2-mile
journey. I also tend to walk around for most of my chores, though
these generally happen only once every few days.

See
[jogging-and-return-walking-with-history.md](jogging-and-return-walking-with-history.md)
for more details.

## Strength exercises

I have done strength exercises off and on, but mostly off, till about
2021. In November 2021, I started doing strength exercises regularly
in November 2021 and have ramped them up slowly since then. See
[strength-exercises-with-history.md](strength-exercises-with-history.md)
for details.

## Standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise

This is a standard exercise of standing on one leg with both eyes
closed. The exercise provides both a measurement of and helps improve
balance.

When I do this exercise, I do one round standing on the right leg, and
one round standing on the left leg.

As of May 2024, my aim is to be able to manage at least 23 seconds on
each leg, with adjustments for colder indoor temperatures. In
practice, I generally do somewhere between 25 and 40 seconds on each
leg.

See
[standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md)
for more details.

## Hand gripper exercise

I started doing hand gripper exercise in July 2023 and have been
ramping up slowly in terms of both the strength of the gripper and the
duration of closing. I use 100 lb, 150 lb, and 200 lb metal hand
grippers. See [here](hand-gripper-exercise-with-history.md) for more
details, including reasons for skipping.

## Breath holds

I generally do two breath holds in quick succession, both max-pause
breath holds, generally for 40 to 60 seconds. See
[breath-holds-with-history.md](breath-holds-with-history.md) for
more background information.
