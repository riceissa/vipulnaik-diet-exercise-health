# Exercise routine

Last major update: September 23, 2023

Last pass of full document review (with updates and corrections where needed): May 17, 2024

This document describes my exercise routine. I intend to update it
when there are changes to my ongoing routine. See also my yearly
exercise tracker docs (such as
[2023-exercise-tracker.md](2023-exercise-tracker.md) and
[2024-exercise-tracker.md](2024-exercise-tracker.md)) where I record
time periods where I deviated from the routine.

## Jogging and return walking

### Frequency: daily

I generally go for a jog + walk once a day.

### Usual route length and jogging/walking split

My usual route is about 1 mile (1.6 km) each way, for a total of 2
miles (3.2 km). The route is punctuated by intersections though none
with traffic lights and pretty much most of the route I have
pedestrian right of way. However, I do generally yield to others since
I'm generally not in a hurry to get anywhere, and if there are
significant traffic logjams I might change my route a little bit.

I aim to jog for the full duration of at least one way (1 mile) plus
at least 40% of the other way (0.4 miles) minus some parts
where I have to slow down (e.g., when crossing a road, or due to dogs
or children nearby who might get excited by somebody moving fast, or
when cars are moving out of parking spots). So in general I aim to jog
at least 1.4 miles and walk the remaining 0.6 miles. When I have
more energy, I may jog a larger portion, and therefore walk back a
shorter residual duration. In general, when reasonably energetic, I
jog about 1.4-1.6 miles and walk back the remaining 0.4-0.6 miles.

Overall, one way (the first 1 mile, mostly jogging) takes me about
12-15 minutes and the return journey (mix of jogging and walking)
takes me about 14-18 minutes.

Prior to 2024-05-29, the threshold was 1.25 miles jogging instead of
the current threshold of 1.4 miles joging.

I record in my exercise tracker file (for instance, [2024 exercise
tracker](2024-exercise-tracker.md) for 2024) when I skip jogging or
jog less than the threshold.

### Gap to meal

If I'm not doing strength exercises after returning, I generally try
to wait at least 10-15 minutes between my return and having a meal,
following [this](2021-01-10-ben-greenfield-hormesis.md). If I jogged
more and had a shorter return walk, I try to increase my wait time
accordingly. Normally, the things I need to catch up with after my
return (such as email, messages, etc.)  effectively uses that time up.

### Abridged routes and potential reasons

In some rare cases, I do not go out the full 1 mile, but rather go out
a shorter distance, generally around half the distance (so 0.5 miles
each way, for a total of 1 mile). Depending on the exact reason, I
might jog fully *both ways* in case of an abridged route, or I might
still jog one way and walk the other. Below are some typical reasons:

* **Probability of rain or other bad weather conditions**: For
  probabilities of rain between 5% and 25%, if weather conditions are
  otherwise good, and if I can't go out at a different time, I might
  choose to go out but do an abridged route, with jogging in both
  directions. In some cases I might also do the abridged route *twice*
  so that I still get the same amount of exercise.

* **Time constraints**: I might need to get back for a meeting, and a
  later time of day wouldn't work for my jog. In such cases I'll do
  the abridged route, but try to jog back all the way to get the full
  amount of jogging.

* **Fatigue**: In some cases I don't feel physically or mentally able
  to do the full route, so I might do the abridged route; in such
  cases I will jog only one way and walk back. Kinds of fatigue
  include: mental fatigue, overall physical "energy level" fatigue,
  and knee/leg fatigue.

### Time of day for jogging

Outside of the winter months, I generally jog in the morning. The
exact time varies but it's usually between 8 AM and 11 AM. The total
duration is about 35-40 minutes (see jogging/walking breakdown
above). I generally jog after passing stool and doing a bit of work in
the morning (whether day job or other things) but before eating
anything. The reason for jogging in the morning is that it's generally
cooler (so better temperature-wise) and it also works well to get that
energy use done in the morning to feel better the whole day.

During the winter months, the mornings can be too cold, so I try to
jog in the afternoon, when it's warmest. This is generally sandwiched
between my meals, so after my morning meal but before my
afternoon/evening meal.

### Reasons for skipping

I have a few different reasons for skipping:

* **Currently raining or highly likely to rain**: Particularly during
  the winter months (around January and February, sometimes December
  and March) it can be raining heavily, or be highly likely to rain,
  throughout the day.

* **Other inclement weather conditions**: Examples include extreme
  heat, extreme cold, and air quality issues.

* **Time constraints during the parts of the day where I usually
  jog**: For instance, outside winter months, I might be unable to jog
  on days where I have a lot of meetings in the morning, Even though I
  might be freer in the afternoon on that day, it might be too hot in
  the afternoon. Similarly, in the winter months, being busy in the
  afternoon might mean I can't go.

* **Overall lack of time**: This could happen if I'm doing a project
  with a tight deadline, or for other reasons I want to work
  continuously on something to not lose my flow.

* **Fatigue**: In some cases, I skip jogging due to fatigue.  Kinds of
  fatigue include: mental fatigue, overall physical "energy level"
  fatigue, and knee/leg fatigue.

* **Sickness or recent medical treatment**: In some cases, I skip
  jogging because I am sick or have recently been sick, even if I am
  not explicitly feeling fatigued. Also, I might skip jogging for a
  day or two after receiving a vaccine or getting a dental procedure.

* **Preemptive break to relax and conserve energy**: If I have a
  medical or dental procedure later in the day, or the next day, I
  might skip jogging. This is to conserve energy and get to a relaxed
  state prior to the appointment, as well as reduce the risk of
  injuries or other challenges right before the appointment. The
  duration of preemptive break could be limited to same-day break or
  extend up to two days prior (more than two days is unlikely). This
  has the added benefit of freeing up some of my time for any other
  preparatory steps I need to take prior to the appointment.

* **Knee rest day**: I generally try to take a day off from jogging at
  least once every 15 days. So, if there's no break happening for any
  of the other reasons for 15 days, I will take a forced knee rest.

## Strength exercises

### Frequency: 2 to 3 days

I generally do strength exercises about once every 2-3 days when
well. The gap is variable between 2 and 3 days, allowing me a bit of
flexibility in terms of time availability, fatigue levels, and other
strength-using stuff during the day (such as shopping).

### Warmup

I always start strength exercises after returning from jogging (within
about 20 minutes of returning). Also, right before starting, I do
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises. The goal of these is
to confirm that my balance is fine -- if there are issues with my
balance, this could increase the risk of injury during strength
exercises.

### Weightlifting

I do my weightlifting exercises while standing on an exercise
mat. This is to reduce the risk of injury from any fall due to loss of
balance.

I have two exercises, that I'll call exercise 1 and exercise 2 for
now.

I have pairs of weights of 2 lb each, 3 lb each, 5 lb each, and 8 lb
each. I don't use the 2 lb pair any more for my regular exercise. Here
is my sequence:

* 3 lb pair, exercise 1: about 15 repetitions

* 3 lb pair, exercise 2: about 15 repetitions

* 5 lb pair, exercise 1: about 15 repetitions

* 5 lb pair, exercise 2: about 15 repetitions

* 8 lb pair, exercise 1: about 15 repetitions

* 8 lb pair, exercise 2: about 10 repetitions; this is the exercise
  where I am currently reaching my peak number of repetitions before
  getting fatigued

The reason I always start with the 3 lb is for a mix of warmup and
verification purposes. If, on a given day, I find that the 3 lb pair
is fatiguing me or I am having trouble with it, I can pause the
weightlifting before proceeding to a higher weight where there is more
risk of injury.

### Pushups

After the weights, I proceed to do pushups on the exercise mat.

To count a pushup, I require my nose to touch the exercise mat. As the
mat can curl up a bit, the level can be about 1-2 inches above the
level of my hands.

I generally stay in the pushup position through the exercise. I do 4-8
repetitions and then break (while staying in the pushup position) for
leg stretches. Then I continue with the pushups.

The number of pushups I can manage can vary quite a bit. When I'm
feeling low on energy, it's in the range of 10-15. When I am higher on
energy, it's in the range of 17-22.

### Gap to meal

I generally try to wait at least 30 minutes between the finishing of
strength exercises and my next meal, following
[this](2021-01-10-ben-greenfield-hormesis.md), though I do try to
drink water immediately upon completion of the strength exercises.

### Reasons for skipping

Since I do strength exercises after returning from jogging, any of the
reasons for skipping jogging also lead to skipping strength
exercises. However, since the frequency of strength exercises is once
every 2-3 days, with variability in whether I do 2 or 3 days, I may
skip jogging on one day without effectively skipping strength
exercises.

In addition, I may skip strength exercises for these reasons:

* **Post-jogging fatigue or hunger**: In some cases, I am feeling fine
  before I start jogging, but jogging fatigues me or gets me to a
  state of hunger where I don't want to create a further delay to
  eating by doing weights.

* **Muscle aches or abdominal discomfort**: Even beyond a clear
  sickness, if I am feeing any kind of aches or strain on the muscles
  that I expect to use heavily during strength exercises, I skip the
  strength exercises.

* **Pre- and post-break for vaccination**: For vaccination (or any
  other injection into the muscle) I have a pre-break of three days
  and a post-break of one week for strength exercises. For blood
  draws, I have a pre-break of one day and a post-break of three days
  for strength exercises.

## Standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise

This is a standard exercise of standing on one leg with both eyes
closed. The exercise provides both a measurement of and helps improve
balance.

When I do this exercise, I do one round standing on the right leg, and
one round standing on the left leg.

As of May 2024, my aim is to be able to manage at least 20 seconds on
each leg, with adjustments for colder indoor temperatures. In
practice, I generally do somewhere between 23 and 40 seconds on each
leg.

See
[2023-10-28-standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed.md](2023-10-28-standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed.md)
for more details.

## Hand gripper exercise

I use 100 lb, 150 lb, and 200 lb metal hand grippers. See
[here](hand-gripper-exercise-with-history.md) for more details.

### Reasons for skipping

* **Sickness or recent medical treatment**: See similar explanation
  for jogging.

* **Preemptive break to relax and conserve energy**: See similar
  explanation for jogging.

* **Hand injury**: If I have a cut on one of the hands, I want to skip
  the hand gripper exercises for that hand to avoid putting stress
  on the cut.

* **Preemptive break to improve hand appearance**: If there are
  particular reasons I really care about having good hands, I might
  take a break from the hand gripper (or at least the 150 lb hand
  gripper).

## Breath holds

I generally do two breath holds in quick succession, both max-pause
breath holds, generally for 40 to 60 seconds. See
[2023-07-30-buteyko-breathing.md](2023-07-30-buteyko-breathing.md) for
more background information.
