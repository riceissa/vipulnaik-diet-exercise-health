# Standing on toes with eyes closed (with history)

I've been doing this exercise daily starting Monday 2024-09-09,
generally as a followup to [standing on one leg with eyes
closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md).

The process is as follows:

* Stand on my toes (both feet). Both the toes and the portion of the
  foot right before the toe can be in contact with the ground.

* Close my eyes when the seconds counter hits a multiple of 5; note
  the current time.

* Continue to try to stand until I lose balance and have to lift one
  of my feet and place it elsewhere; open my eyes and note the elapsed
  time.

My initial goal is to have a median of at least 15 seconds over the
first 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 tries (however many are needed).
