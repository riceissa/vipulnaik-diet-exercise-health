# Standing on toes with eyes closed (with history)

## Goal and functional relevance of exercise

### Build standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed duration to at least 30 seconds

The ability to sustain weight on toes is important for balance, as we
lift off from our toes, and when jogging, we are lifting off from the
toes of just one foot. The eyes-closed version of the exercise just
raises the stakes so as to get more bang per second of exercise.

When I started standing-on-toes-with-eyes-closed on 2024-09-09, I set
a threshold of 15 seconds. Even this threshold, I was not able to
consistently clear on the first try, leading to me doing 3 or 5 tries
on many days.

I don't have standard benchmarks for this, but my guess is that if I
can consistently do 30 seconds or more, I would start hitting
diminishing returns in terms of this exercise, and can sustain it.

## Standing on toes with eyes closed: standard version

I've been doing this exercise daily starting Monday 2024-09-09,
generally as a followup to [standing on one leg with eyes
closed](standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md).

The process is as follows:

* Stand on my toes (both feet). Both the toes and the portion of the
  foot right before the toe can be in contact with the ground.

* Close my eyes when the seconds counter hits a multiple of 5; note
  the current time.

* Continue to try to stand until I lose balance and have to lift one
  of my feet and place it elsewhere; open my eyes and note the elapsed
  time.

My initial goal is to have a median of at least 15 seconds over the
first 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 tries (however many are needed).
