# Health profile

Last major update: July 12, 2024

Last pass of full document review (with updates and corrections where
needed): October 17, 2024

This is the health profile for Vipul Naik. It is updated
periodically. It does not include details of specific
events/incidents; these are generally recorded in their own respective
files. Links to the most recent and/or relevant incidents are included
here.

When updating this document:

* Make sure that I have the latest blood pressure readings.
* Make sure to update the links to the last dental appointment and the
  last eye exam.
* Make sure to update the HbA1c and lipid profile section to reflect
  the latest test results.
* Update all occurrences of "as of `<year>`" to the correct year,
  after verifying that the assertion still holds.
* Go through the whole document to see if anything else needs updating.

## Ongoing incidents

This section lists and links to ongoing incidents. This section was
last updated November 1, 2024. I hope to update this section whenever
there's a new incident or the status of an existing incident changes
significantly. I remove from here incidets that I consider closed; I
may consider an incident closed once the healing is well on its way
and it is no longer meaningfully affected my daily life, even if not
all of its ramifications have been fully addressed.

As of November 1, 2024, there are no ongoing incidents. See recent
incidents under the [events/2024 folder](../events/2024/).

## Vital signs

### Heart rate

My resting, seated heart rate, as measured by my Omron blood pressure
machine as well as my Zacurate pulse oximeter, is generally 42-60 bpm
in the morning in summer (before eating or exercise), and a little
higher under comparable conditions in the winter.

My heart rate goes up by about 10-15 bpm when I stand up, and then
stabilizes down to about 5 bpm higher than my seated heart rate.

After I return home from jogging, my heart rate is generally in the
70-100 bpm range. It generally takes about an hour to drop to be
stably in the 60s, which is still higher than my pre-exercise heart
rate.

My heart rate after eating (for the first two hours after eating) is
generally somewhat elevated, in the range of 60-80 bpm. The heart rate
peaks around 0.5-1.5 hours after finishing my meal.

Generally, when my resting heart rate exceeds 75 bpm outside of the
post-exercise context, I can "feel" my heart racing. After I took
antibiotics as part of my recovery process from the [2023-07-05 wisdom
tooth removal (left
side)](../events/2023/2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md),
there were periods where I could feel my heart racing. I didn't have
the pulse oximeter at the time, so I relied on crude measurement of my
heart rate, and the crude estimate was around 80 bpm.

I record my heart rate (measured using the Omron blood pressure
machine) as part of my monthly blood pressure readings (as well as
other one-off readings in response to health events or other
incidents) in
[blood_pressure_readings.sql](../sql/blood_pressure_readings.sql). As
of 2024-10-13, my latest morning heart rate readings from the BP
machine (before exercise or eating) as measured as part of blood
pressure measurement were on 2024-10-13 with successive readings of 53
bpm and 49 bpm.

I also record my heart rate and SpO2 as part of my monthly pulse
oximeter readings (as well as other one-off readings in response to
health events or other incidents) in
[pulse_oximeter_readings.sql](../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql). As
of 2024-10-13, my latest morning heart rate reading from the pulse
oximeter (before exercise or eating) as measured by the pulse oximeter
was on 2024-10-13 with a range of 49-55 bpm.

For extensive older experiment results, see
[2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md](../events/2023/2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md).

### SpO2 (saturation percentage of oxygen)

My SpO2 is about 97% most of the time (sometimes going up to 98% and
sometimes going down to 96%). It is a little higher in the mornings
(around 99%). It can drop to as low as 92% and briefly go down even as
low as 85% when I do an extended breath hold, but it quickly rebounds
and even overshoots before settling back to its equilibrium value.

I also record my heart rate and SpO2 as part of my monthly pulse
oximeter readings (as well as other one-off readings in response to
health events or other incidents) in
[pulse_oximeter_readings.sql](../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql). My
most recent reading taken on 2024-10-13 was a range of 99% to 100%
over a period of one minute.

For recent pulse oximeter readings, see
[pulse_oximeter_readings.sql](../sql/pulse_oximeter_readings.sql).

For historical results, see
[2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md](../events/2023/2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md).

### Temperature

My temperature, as measured by a non-contact forehead infrared
thermometer, ranges from 97.6 to 99. Temperatures at the high end of
this range, when I am feeling well, are generally due to high ambient
temperatures for an extended period of time. See
[2021-08-temperature-baseline.md](../events/2021/2021-08-temperature-baseline.md)
for a historical established temperature baseline.

### Blood pressure

My most recent at-home resting blood pressure readings (taken
2024-10-13) were 106/67 and 100/64. I've had home blood pressure
readings with the systolic between 91 and 115 and the diastolic
between 55 and 75.

For more on my history of blood pressure readings, see
[blood_pressure_readings.sql](../sql/blood_pressure_readings.sql).

## Physical build

### Height

My height is a tad over 5 feet 9 inches. This puts me a little below
average height for an adult male.

### Weight

My weight is between 56 kg and 58 kg, or between 123 lb and 128
lb. According to online BMI calculators, this puts me at a BMI at the
low end of the normal category, just a little above the underweight
threshold.

My weight used to be about 120 lb or 54 kg around 2017, and appears to
have gradually increased over the years, likely partly related to an
increase in muscle mass.

### Waist size

I have a lean, athletic appearance. My waist size is at the "small"
end, with shorts/trousers sizes of 28 and 30 generally working for me,
with 28 being the most preferred (no belt needed), 30 needing a loose
belt, and 32 being manageable with a tight belt. I do not have a
paunch.

## Dental status

* I generally get dental checkups and cleaning done every 6-7
  months. As of 2024, my dental care is handled by Total Health Dental
  Care, and I go to the branch at 3017 Telegraph Avenue. The notes for
  the most recent appointment should reflect the current status of my
  dental health. Look in the folder `events/<year>` for files with the
  word `dental-cleaning` in them to locate the most recent
  appointment. As of the last edit of this document,
  [this](../events/2024/2024-10-09-dental-cleaning.md) is my most
  recent appointment.

* All four of my wisdom teeth have been removed. The removal was done
  in 2023: [overall doc](../events/2023/2023-wisdom-tooth-removal.md), [left
  side](../events/2023/2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md), and [right
  side](../events/2023/2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md).

* I got periodontal therapy in September / October 2021, i.e., I had a
  below-the-gumline deep cleaning done. For more details, see [first
  appointment](../events/2021/2021-09-29-periodontal-therapy-first-appointment.md),
  [second
  appointment](../events/2021/2021-10-06-periodontal-therapy-second-appointment.md),
  and [followup
  appointment](../events/2021/2021-12-15-periodontal-therapy-followup-appointment.md).

* My [December 2018 document on a bunch of related
  pains](../events/2018/2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md) that I experienced,
  including dental pain, and that also marked the start of my
  photosensitivity, may be worth reading.

## Eye status

* I get eye exams every 1-2 years. As of 2024, I get my eye exams from
  UC Berkeley Optometry. Look in the `events/<year>` folders for files
  with `eye-exam` in them to locate information on my eye exams. The
  most recent one is generally the one to pay attention to. As of the
  last major edit of this document,
  [this](../events/2023/2023-10-04-eye-exam.md) is my most recent eye
  exam.

* I have some issues with distance vision, as evinced in the eye exam
  results. Since I don't drive, and the issues haven't gotten in my
  way so far, I have not chosen to get corrective lenses for these
  issues.

* Other things surfaced by my eye exam: (benevolent so far) melanosis,
  and a difference in the inner/outer ratio between my left and right
  eye (seen through fundus photos). To monitor for trends in either
  eye, I get fundus photos taken with each eye exam (this costs an
  extra $20).

* I have a mild form of photosensitivity, whereby being in sunlight or
  indoor lighting for an extended period of time (generally over an
  hour) can cause me to get fatigued. I have adjusted to this by
  getting sunglasses for outdoor trips, using dark mode and low-light
  settings for my electronics use, and keeping the lights off in the
  evening / at night most of the time. For more on the practices I
  follow (or try to follow), see [best practices around
  light](../best-practices/best-practices-around-light.md).

  The photosensitivity started along with my [Decemer 2018
  head/neck/jaw/tooth
  pain](../events/2018/2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md).

## Physical exam

As of May 2024, my last full physical exam by a medical professional
was in December 2016, when I went to a gastro specialist for my
stomach pain issues. See
[here](../events/2016/2016-11-to-2016-12-stomach-pain-and-resolution.md#doctor-visit)
for more context.

On 2024-04-30, I had an abdominal exam and vitals measurements as part
of my [urgent care visit](../events/2024/2024-04-30-urgent-care-visit-and-tests.md).

Starting May 2024, I have been doing monthly physical self-exams that
include blood pressure measurement, auscultation of the abdomen and
heart sound,s and palpation of the abdomen. I take notes and
investigate further if I notice anything unusual. As of October 2024,
my most recent blood pressure measurement was on 2024-10-13 and my
most recent palpation check and stethoscope check were on 2024-09-28.

## HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, and liver function tests

One of the sets of metrics I get tested every few years is my lipid
profile and HbA1c. This is due to a family history of diabetes and
other complications. For the full list of readings, see
[test_results.sql](../sql/test_results.sql).

### HbA1c

The HbA1c is a percentage, though the percentage sign is usually
omitted from the readings. 6.5 and higher is considered diabetic, 5.7
to 6.4 is considered prediabetic, and 4 to 5.6 is considered normal.

My HbA1c has never been measured in the prediabetic range. In December
2016, when I was having stomach issues, and in general had a
relatively unhealthy diet with more consumption of hot chocolate (a
sugary drink) and outside food, my HbA1c was at 5.5, a little below
the prediabetic range.

However, my more recent reading as of June 2021 gives a HbA1c of 5.0.

My reading in September 2024 came to 5.5. However, a note on the Quest
Diagnostics website suggested changes to the measurement method that
may increase measured HbA1c by up to 0.3 percentage points.

### Lipid profile

I've taken lipid profile measurements starting April 2004, with my
most recent measurement being in September 2024 as part of my [2024 blood
test plans](../events/2024/2024-blood-test-plans.md).

Overall, my most recent lipid profile (as of 2024) is close enough to
normal, but this is something I need to continue monitoring given
family diabetic tendencies.

#### Cholesterol total (acceptable range: 0-200 mg/dL)

My cholesterol total has always stayed within range. Overall, it
appears to have been increasing somewhat from ~150 in 2004 to being
only slightly below the upper limit of 200 in the last test in
2021. However, in 2024, it dropped a little bit from the 2021 level,
getting to 177. This is a step in the positive direction.

#### HDL cholesterol (acceptable range: 30-60 mg/dL, some sources say >= 40 mg/dL)

My first cholesterol HDL reading, done 2004, showed a result of 28,
below the acceptable range. Since then, my HDL has been generally
increasing. The last two readings (2021 and 2024) were both at 46,
which are within the range.

#### LDL cholesterol (acceptable range: 0-100 mg/dL)

My LDL cholesterol measurements have always hovered around the
threshold, with the very first reading in April 2004 being 99, just
below the threshold of 100. My last two measurements, in June 2021 and
September 2024, both were above the threshold, at 122 and 112
respectively.

As of October 2024, I plan to do more frequent monitoring of this, and
have also taken various actions that I am hoping will help reduce my
LDL cholesterol over time. I plan to get tested for a wider range of
related metrics, including getting a NMR lipoprofile at least once and
getting Apo B measurements regularly, as these offer a better proxy of
atherosclerotic risk than LDL cholesterol. See [2025 blood test
plans](../events/2025/2025-blood-test-plans.md) for some of my future
plans on this front.

#### Serum triglycerides (acceptable range: 0-150 mg/dL)

My last two serum triglycerides readings (June 2021 and September
2024) have been 124 and 79, both of them within range, with the
September 2024 reading being particularly good.

### Insulin (uIU/mL)

I have gotten tested for insulin twice, in June 2021 and September
2024 respectively. My readings were respectively 3.6 and 4.6, well
below the threshold of concern (set at 19.6 originally but reduced to
18.4). The levels seem low enough to suggest that I don't have insulin
resistance at this stage.

## Infectious diseases and vaccines

See [vaccine_administrations.sql](../sql/vaccine_administrations.sql)
for a full list of vaccine administrations I received starting
December 2014 (I also have a record of childhood vaccinations in a
private repository). For some vaccine administrations, I also have an
individual notes file about the vaccine administration; the notes file
is linked from the notes column of the SQL.

### COVID-19

I have never been diagnosed with COVID-19, and am fairly confident
that I have not been infected with COVID-19.

I tested myself once (on 2022-04-06) for COVID-19 using at at-home
test, when I was having a fever. I tested negative. The fever was
likely an aftereffect of an injury. See
[here](../events/2022/2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md#covid-19-antigent-test)
for details.

I got my primary COVID-19 vaccine series from Pfizer in 2021 (in May
2021 and [June
2021](../events/2021/2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md)). Since then, I have
been getting a booster every year, with the booster some time between
November and January. As of the writing of this document, my most
recent vaccine was on [January 12,
2024](../events/2024/2024-01-12-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md).

Starting with my second COVID-19 dose and then for each booster dose
(though much less pronounced for the January 2024 dose), I
have reacted with a slight fever; the fever has generally subsided
within 36 hours of getting the dose. With successive boosters, both
the onset of the fever and its resolution have tended to get faster.

### Influenza (flu)

I'm reasonably confident that I have not had the flu or any other
influenza-like illness (ILI) since 2014.

I have been getting annual flu shots since around 2010 (though I might
have missed a year or two in between). I generally get the flu shot
some time between September and December each year.

I have records of the date of vaccination starting 2015; this
information is available in
[vaccine_administrations.sql](../sql/vaccine_administrations.sql). My
most recent administration was in [October
2024](../events/2024/2024-10-25-flu-shot.md).

In general, I have not had significant reactions to the flu shot. The
main symptom has been slight soreness in the area of administration
for the next day. For my [October 2023 flu
shot](../events/2023/2023-10-13-flu-shot.md), the soreness continued
in a relatively mild form for about a week, and might have been causal
in some stiffness in the neck and shoulder as well. I believe this was
due to an interaction with hand gripper exercises, that I [started
doing in July
2023](../events/2023/2023-07-29-hand-gripper-exercise.md). Since then,
I have implemented [best practices around vaccine
appointments](../best-practices/best-practices-around-vaccine-appointments.md)
that include stopping strength exercises and hand gripper exercises a
few days prior to the vaccine and resuming them a few days after the
vaccine.

### Tdap (whooping cough)

My most recent Tdap vaccine was on 2024-07-12 (July 12, 2024); see
[here](../events/2024/2024-07-12-tdap-vaccine-booster-dose.md) for
details. This was a 10-year booster dose. My previous Tdap vaccine was
on 2014-12-15, after a major running fall.

### Childhood vaccines

I got the standard set of vaccines as a young child in India. Prior to
moving to the United States for graduate study, I reviewed my vaccine
history and got a few additional vaccines to be compliant with the
requirements (including possibly vaccines that I had already gotten as
a child but didn't have a record of). Details of my childhood vaccines
have been digitized but are not included publicly due to potential
sensitivity of some of the data (including the ability to infer date
of birth / place of birth from the timing of some of the vaccine
series).

### Common cold and sore throat / running nose

I have had occasional cases of sore throat / running nose, that I
believe might be due to the common cold or other causes, such as
dietary irritants. In all the cases, I suspect dietary irritants
rather than respiratory cold viruses as the cause, but I might be
wrong in some of the cases.

* [2023-08-04 sore throat suspected to be due to sauerkraut and red
  chutney
  consumption](../events/2023/2023-08-04-sauerkraut-red-chutney-and-sore-throat.md):
  This was during my recovery period from my [2023-07-05 wisdom tooth
  removal (left side)](../events/2023/2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md),
  and was likely due to aftereffects of the wisdom tooth removal
  itself or my body's adverse reaction to the preventative antibiotic
  (clindamycin) that I took after the procedure.

* [2021-08-28 sore throat after
  meals](../events/2021/2021-08-28-sore-throat-after-meals.md): Just a sore throat,
  no runny nose; I addressed this with some remedial measures.

* [2021-02-27 sauerkraut and sore
  throat](../events/2021/2021-02-27-sauerkraut-and-sore-throat.md): Just a sore
  throat, no runny nose; I addressed this by briefly taking a break
  from sauerkraut.

* [2019-08-30 Thai yellow curry and subsequent
  cold](../events/2019/2019-08-30-thai-yellow-curry-and-subsequent-cold.md): After
  having a huge amount of Thai yellow cury, I had a runny nose. The
  runny nose recovered quickly. I believe it was throat irritation and
  not a viral cold, but I'm not sure.

Overall, my incidence of runny nose has been very low since I moved to
Berkeley in 2014; the above incident list is likely comprehensive
starting 2019, and there may have been equivalent/similar incidents at
a similar frequency going back to 2014.

From 2007 to 2013 I was in Chicago and got clear-cut cases of the
common cold (not attributable to anything dietary) once every 1-2
years.

In my childhood, I used to get common colds quite often (perhaps even
more frequently than my peers).

### Other cases of fever (excluding after vaccines)

* [2022-04-05 fall and phone screen
  crack](../events/2022/2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md): I had a brief
  fever after the injury; slight fever after injuries is expected.

* [2021-08-22 fever and rash](../events/2021/2021-08-22-fever-and-rash.md): I had a
  brief fever and rash the day after I cleaned out a nest and had a
  bunch of stuff fall on me during the cleaning process.

* [2020-07-28 fever
  episode](../events/2020/2020-coronavirus-activity-tracker#tuesday-july-28) that
  resolved after a long night's sleep.

### Childhood diseases

#### Chickenpox

I got chickenpox when I was around 4 or 5.

#### Ear infection

I got an ear infection before the age of 4, due to which I lost about
60% of my hearing. Fortunately, the infection was detected quickly and
I was operated on and recovered my hearing.

## Injuries

See [accidents.sql](../sql/accidents.sql) that includes accidents that
injured me or damaged my stuff. The most significant injuries since
2014 that affected me bodily are listed below:

* [2022-04-05 fall and phone screen
  crack](../events/2022/2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md): This was a
  running fall accompanied by a phone screen crack.

* [2019-09-10 traffic accident](../events/2019/2019-09-10-traffic-accident.md): I was
  hit by a car at a stop sign (traveling very slowly).

* 2014-12-15 running fall: This was a major running fall, that
  prompted me to get a Tdap vaccine and sit with my knees spread out
  for a few days.

## Lifestyle

### Largely sedentary lifestyle with deliberate exercise

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, I have
predominantly worked from home. Outside of daily jogging, I don't have
daily outside-the-house trips. Beyond that, I do outside trips for
grocery shopping, picking up takeout food, toiletry shopping, and some
other chores.

### Mostly computer-based day

While at home, I spend most of the day on the computer, both when
working and for most of my personal tasks. Even when eating and for
the cutting portions of meal prep, particularly the cutting of
vegetables, I am in front of a computer (usually watching a movie, TV
show, or other video, sometimes reading material). When doing at-home
strength exercises, I sometimes have a podcast on.

The above has been approximately true for several years, but it's been
becoming more true since the switch to work-from-home and the increase
in the extent to which things can be handled online.

### Walking for most outside trips

For most outside trips, I walk both ways. I use mass transit (usually
Bay Area Rapid Transit, occasionally a bus) once every few months,
generally only when the location I'm going to is more than 45 minutes
away walking, and sometimes when walking is difficult due to weather
conditions. I don't have a car and almost never use taxi or rideshare
services.

I used BART a lot more prior to the switch to work-from-home in March
2020, and since I was using BART more in general to commute to work
(that was quite far from my home) I was used to using it even for
somewhat shorter trips. So the switch to work-from-home has really
helped change the way I use and think about BART.

The switch to part-time work in March 2023 has led me to switch
further in the direction of walking. Specifically, it's changed the
distance threshold at which I decide to use BART instead of
walking. When time was scarcer, I would tend to use BART at walking
distances of 30 minutes or more; now the threshold is about 45 minutes
and in some cases even higher. In particular, in practice pretty much
anything that can be done in Berkeley or in areas bordering Berkeley
(such as North Oakland, Albany, or Emeryville) I would do by walking.

### Low-stress job

Since my job is part-time, and the systems I am working on are mostly
stable, there are rarely time-sensitive urgent things to handle, and
the total amount of work is relatively easy to manage. Overall, I
would describe my job as low-stress.

This is a relatively recent development. The period from 2018 to 2020
was a period of relatively high stress at the job. Starting 2021, my
workload-related stress has been reducing. There was an increase in
some aspects of stress after a job switch, but this was not so much
due to "too much work" and more due to challenges related to the
nature of the work. After my return to my old job in March 2023, and
the switch to part-time, I haven't had any job-related stress. There
have been brief bursts of working hard, but these have been mostly
optional and a choice I made to get ahead on some fronts.

Aspects that help keep things low-stress:

* Part-time nature of job
* Relative absence of urgent / time-sensitive tasks
* Familiarity with the systems I'm working with (developed over
  several years)
* Good interpersonal relations at the job and lack of conflict
* Work-from-home with fairly flexible hours (so commuting time is low,
  I have flexibility regarding when I wake up, and I have enough
  flexibility that I rarely have to worry about missing exercise for
  the whole day because something came up in the morning)
* Low meeting load and no strict requirement to turn the camera on
  during meetings

### Low pollution

Typically, the air quality index (AQI) in Berkeley is between 20 and
35. This is considered good. Subjectively, I rarely feel like I'm in
polluted settings.

Air quality can sometimes get bad due to smoke from forest fires
farther away. In such cases, I can take additional precautions such as
taking a break from outdoor trips, closing windows, and masking up if
I do need to go outdoors. See [2023-09-19 onward air quality
issues](../events/2023/2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md) for an example of
such an incident.

### No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs

#### Smoking

I have never smoked or used other nicotine-based products.

I have not been exposed to any significant amount of secondhand or
thirdhand smoke. I haven't been indoors with somebody smoking for the
past several years as of 2024, and have only briefly passed by or
trailed people smoking outdoors occasionally.

#### Alcohol

I do not consume any alcoholic beverages, and have never consumed
alcoholic beverages in a significant amount. I have sipped small
amounts of alcoholic beverages to get a sense of how they taste and
smell.

Cough syrup that I consumed (and mostly didn't like) as a child did
contain a nontrivial amount of alcohol.

#### Recreational drugs

I have not personally tried, or been in a closed room with other
people trying, recreational drugs.

## Diet

See https://vipulnaik.com/diet/ for a page with more details on
specific foodstuffs and places I eat or used to eat at, with a focus
on dietary developments from 2014 to 2023.

### Childhood diet

As a child, I followed a vegetarian diet, primarily as a
result of growing up in a vegetarian household in India.

On the vegatarian/vegan distinction:

* Milk and milk products: I had milk products regularly; most significantly,
  curd/yogurt. I also had other milk products to varying degrees,
  including milk, cheese, cottage cheese (paneer), though toward my
  teen years I had phased many of these out.

* Eggs: I remember having egg-based products (omelets, egg-based
  cakes) a few times as a child, but these were not part of my regular
  diet.

* Honey: I remember having honey (jams, marmalades) occasionally, but
  this was not a regular part of my diet.

Due to a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart problems,
I was conscious from a relatively young age of the importance of
reducing the intake of sugar and fried foods, and of keeping
carbohydrate consumption to a modicum.

### Changes to diet

As an adult, I have mostly continued with my childhood diet, with
minor modifications. For a period of time in between, I used to
consume hot chocolate drinks daily (from Starbucks or similar
places). Although I didn't consume them for the sugar content, they
did have higher sugar content than the rest of my diet. In 2019, after
[encountering dental problems](../events/2018/2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md)
that were partly related to this consumption, I phased out hot
chocolate consumption by May 2019. Since then, I have had very low
consumption of sugary foods.

At some point around 2018/2019, I transitioned from a vegetarian to a
vegan diet, mostly for ethical reasons, but also believing that there
would not be significant adverse health impacts. By this point, I was
already taking Vitamin D supplements, and I introduced sauerkraut into
my diet to make up for the loss of active cultures from stopping the
consumption of yogurt.

### Current diet

You can get a general sense of my current diet by looking at my [food
preparations and openings](../sql/food_preparations_and_openings.sql);
this data goes back to 2024-05-30 (May 30, 2024). I also have food
purchase data going further back to 2021-03-10 (March 10, 2021), at
[food purchases](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

I also keep track of my food waste [here](../sql/food_waste.sql).

Myy waste-adjusted food preparations and openings present a reasonably accurate
picture of my food consumption. The queries at
[food_preparations_and_openings_verification_queries.py](../python/food_preparations_and_openings_verification_queries.py)
show how to aggregate the data to make inferences regarding nutrients;
my plan is to eventually make a portal out of this data so that it's
easy to browse.

Here are some highlights of my current diet:

* It is vegan in the sense that none of the food I *regularly* consume
  uses animal products. However, I am not particular about vegan
  certification per se. On occasion, when eating out, I may have
  something milk-based, such as a *raita*, if it comes as part of a
  dish I otherwise want to have.

* As part of the data entry of foods I have prepared and opened, I run
  the verification queries alluded to above. These queries flag
  significant deviations from my nutrient targets as well as
  consumption of specific foods that goes outside the expected
  bounds. I plan to continue refining and updating the verification
  queries to provide ongoing monitoring of my consumption patterns.

* The proportion of my food I eat that is restaurant takeout or
  equivalent (prepped meals) is, as of mid-2024, very small -- about
  one meal a month, possibly a bit more in case of travel. This
  represents a sharp drop since mid-to-late 2023, where I was doing
  takeout about once a week on average. The 2023 level is in turn
  lower than 2020-2022, which in turn is lower than the pre-pandemic
  level.

* Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I've basically
  stopped eating out except for cases where I'm meeting others; I
  instead do takeout. I have continued this practice and expect to
  continue it indefinitely, as it has several benefits.

* There's also a trend within my supermarket consumption for the food
  to move away from pre-packed meals to home-prepped meals. For
  instance, I used to get pre-cooked chana masala, vegetable biryani,
  and misal curry from Trader Joe's, but by early 2022, I had stopped
  getting all of these. This was to the point that I haven't needed a
  microwave oven at all since 2022.

* As of 2024, I have basically zero sugar-heavy foods or drinks.

* I have two meals a day on a typical day. My first meal is generally
  after my morning exercise (with a suitable waiting period in between
  where feasible) and my second meal is in the evening. The only
  planned-for differences between the meals are as follows:

  * I try to take all my supplements with the first meal.

  * I try to take sauerkraut or kimchi only with the first meal (the
    goal is to limit it to one meal, and doing it on the first meal is
    easier).

  * I take seaweed with my second meal, i.e., the meal where I'm not
    taking sauerkraut.

## Digestive cycle

### Bowel movement cycle

I have daily morning bowel movements. Generally, after I wake up and
urinate, I spend about 10-15 minutes on the computer catching up on my
morning checklist, allowing the pressure to build up, then I have a
bowel movement.

Occasionally I have an additional bowel movement later in the day, or
am unable to have a bowel movement in the morning. These cases are
very unusual. The frequency of such incidents is generally less than
one per month under normal conditions.

I've basically adhered to this bowel movement cycle pretty
regularly. Disruptions have been as follows:

* After the consumption of clindamycin after the [2023-07-05 wisdom
  tooth removal (left
  side)](../events/2023/2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md), one of the
  side-effects was diarrhea; there was digestive cycle disruption for
  a few weeks even as the diarrhea subsided.

* The [2024-04-25
  incident](../events/2024/2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md) was a case of
  severe abdominal pain accompanying constipation-like symptoms,
  though I still did have a bowel movement everyday -- just a
  smaller-than-usual one on 2024-04-25 and 2024-04-26. My bowel
  movement cycle returned to normal on 2024-04-27.

* As part of the [2024-07-18 onward
  incident](../events/2024/2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md),
  for a period of about a month, despite having regular morning bowel
  movement every day, I had cases where I felt bowel pressure later in
  the day and went for additional bowel movements, most of them
  successful. See
  [here](../events/2024/2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md#bowel-movement-cycle)
  for more details.

* Travel-related disruptions: My digestive cycle takes about 2-3 days
  to return to normal after travel that results in timezone change. I
  still have a bowel movement within every 48 hours, but the timing
  may be off. However, short travel within the same timezone is
  generally not disruptive (such as travel from the San Francisco Bay
  Area to Portland or Bengaluru to Chennai).

* Disruptions due to waking up early for something: On 2024-04-21, I
  used an alarm to wake up about 2 hours prior to my normal waking-up
  time, and was unable to have a bowel movement that day. This might
  have been one of the causal factors for the 2024-04-25 abdominal
  pain alluded to above.

* Bowel movement after intense food consumption: On 2024-03-27, I ate
  with work colleagues at Tay Ho Restaurant in Oakland. A combination
  of urine suppression and the spicy food that I'm not used to having,
  led to me having a bowel movement when I got back home. This kind of
  incident is rare.

### Abdominal discomfort

In 2023, I had diarrhea and basically a digestive reset of sorts as a
result of clindamycin consumption; see my [2023-07-05 wisdom tooth
removal (left
side)](../events/2023/2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md)
for details. As far as I can make out, I recovered in a few weeks.

In 2024, I have had more mysterious cases of abdominal discomfort,
that might have related causes. I've documented these incidents to
varying degrees of detail. The three main clusters of events are as
follows:

* [2024-04-25 abdominal pain](../events/2024/2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md): This was
  characterized by severe pain and led to an urgent care trip and
  bloodwork. However, most of the recovery was quick.

* [2024-07-18 excessive morning activity and abdominal pain in the
  afternoon](../events/2024/2024-07-18-excessive-morning-activity-and-abdominal-pain-in-the-afternoon.md);
  This had less of an acute/severe manifestation but did continue for
  longer. It included abdominal discomfort, flatulence, bloating and
  cramping sensations (no visible distension), and symptoms in the
  vicinty of constipation despite regular daily bowel movements. This
  led me to do a lot of research into potential causes. I also took a
  number of steps including temporary FODMAP restriction (eventually
  reversed after I felt better). Potential causes are described in the
  document.

* [2024-10-08 onward abdominal discomfort and other
  symptoms](../events/2024/2024-10-08-onward-abdominal-discomfort-and-other-symptoms.md):
  As of the last edit of this document, this is the latest iteration
  of the issue. It's milder than previous iterations and I have not
  needed to make temporary adjustments to diet and exercise.

Some of the changes I've made based on these:

* I purchased a FoodMarble Aire 2 and take regular fermentation score
  readings. See [here](../sql/foodmarble_aire_2_breath_tests.sql). At
  least after the purchase, I have not seen consistent issues with
  hydrogen and methane fermentation levels, which has given me more
  confidence that at least as of now, I am unlikely to be experiencing
  small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) or intestinal
  methanogen overgrowth (IMO). (This still leaves open the possibility
  that I did experience IMO in past incidents).

* I purchased and experimented with Atrantil; see
  [here](../events/2024/2024-10-02-atrantil-purchase.md). This is
  generally good for digestive health, and is particularly helps if I
  get IMO (or something in the direction of it).

* I built and refined best practices in a number of areas:

  Documents directly related to food, digestive cycle, and abdominal discomfort:

  * [Best practices around abdominal discomfort](../best-practices/best-practices-around-abdominal-discomfort.md)

  * [Best practices around bowel disruption due to sleep and stress](../best-practices/best-practices-around-bowel-disruption-due-to-sleep-and-stress.md)

  * [Best practices around intense and hard food consumption](../best-practices/best-practices-around-intense-and-hard-food-consumption.md)

  Best practices in other areas that were likely contributors:

  * [Best practices around
    sleep](../best-practices/best-practices-around-sleep.md) since I
    suspect that sleep cycle disruption was a contributing factor in
    the 2024-04-25 and 2024-10-08 cases (though not in itself very
    severe).

  * [Best practices around exertion and
    stimulation](../best-practices/best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation.md)
    since I think overexertion has been a contributor to all three
    incidents (and has effects beyond digestive cycle disruption).

### Fermentation scores using the FoodMarble Aire 2

Starting around early September 2024, I have been regularly recording
my hydrogen and methane fermentation scores using the FoodMarble Aire
2. The scores can be found
[here](../sql/foodmarble_aire_2_breath_tests.sql). Although the levels
in most cases seems way below the levels that would indicate an
overgrowth, I find it valuable to continue monitoring so as to be able
to detect an overgrowth before it takes effect. I also suspect that my
2024-07-18 incident might have been related to methanogen overgrowth;
I just didn't have the device at the time to measure my methane
fermentation.

For more on the purchase decision for the FoodMarble Aire 2, see
[here](../events/2024/2024-08-21-foodmarble-aire-2-purchase-decision-process.md).

## Supplements

You can get my supplement consumption history from
[here](../sql/supplements.sql). This may not go back all the way to
when I started consuming the supplements, but it should be reasonably
comprehensive 2020 onward.

For blood test results that include results for the quantity of the
materials supplemented, see
[here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/sql/test_results.sql).

### November 2017: start of supplementation with Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and calcium/magnesium/zinc

I started this supplementation after my November 2017 India visit
where I learned more about my family health history and got my vitamin
levels tested to identify my deficiency. I subsequently switched to
brands that were locally available.

### December 2019: start of omega-3 supplementation

See [here](../events/2019/2019-12-30-decision-to-start-taking-omega-3-supplements.md)
for details of my decision process.

### July 2021: switch to Doctor's Best for Vitamin D supplementation

In July 2021, shortly after my [2021 blood test that confirmed my
continued good Vitamin D levels](../events/2021/2021-blood-test-plans.md), I switched
to a vegan 2500 IU Vitamin D3 supplement from Doctor's Best. I had
previously used the 2000 IU supplement from Finest Nutrition.

### September 2024: increase to dose and diversity of omega-3 supplements

* [2024-09-25: decision to increase omega-3 supplement daily dose](../events/2024/2024-09-25-decision-to-increase-omega-3-supplement-daily-dose.md)
* [2024-09-28: decision to experimentally add another omega-3 supplement](../events/2024/2024-09-28-decision-to-experimentally-add-another-omega-3-supplement.md)

The net of these two decisions is that I now have one dose of
Freshfield and one dose of sapling, both vegan omega-3 supplements.

### October 2024: experimentation with Atrantil

See
[2024-10-02-atrantil-purchase.md](../events/2024/2024-10-02-atrantil-purchase.md)
for more information.

### October and November 2024: experimentation with lysine and n-acetylcysteine

See
[2024-10-16-lysine-purchase.md](../events/2024/2024-10-16-lysine-purchase.md)
and
[2024-10-16-n-acetyl-cysteine-purchase.md](../events/2024/2024-10-16-n-acetyl-cysteine-purchase.md).

### Current supplements

My current supplement regime as of November 2024 is:

* 1 daily 2500 IU vegan Vitamin D3 from Doctor's Best
  * My measured Vitamin D level is solidly in the normal range, but
    since my vegan diet has no Vitamin D3 (except a bit of
    fortification in my almond milk), continuing with the
    supplementation is the safe choice for now.

* 2 daily vegan omega-3, with one from Freshfield and one from sapling

  * Based on non-ideal omega-3 test results in both June 2021 and
    September 2024, I'm increasing my supplement daily dose from 1
    softgel to 2 softgels.

* 1 daily Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc from Nature Made
  * This is just as a safety measure; I don't think I am deficient in
    any of these but it's good to top them up given my vegan diet.

* 1 daily or once-in-two-days Vitamin B12 (supplier can change over time)

  * I target taking 500 mcg daily. When the stock I have is for 1000
    mcg, I take it once every two days instead of daily.

  * I am not currently deficient in Vitamin B12 (the last test in
    September 2024) but this is likely primarily due to
    supplementation. Given my vegan diet, it's better to keep taking
    the supplement. Vitamin B12 is water-soluble so excess should flow
    out.

* 1 daily vegan lysine (600 mg).

* 1 daily vegan n-acetylcysteine with selenium (600 mg).

* Occasional Atrantil consumption in case of significant abdominal discomfort

* Occasional Vitamin C supplement
  * I generally take this before or after events where I expect to be
    more exposed to infection; I don't think I am deficient in Vitamin
    C at all, but since it's water-soluble, excess can easily flow
    out.

* Occasional Vitamin B Complex supplement I may take this occasionally
  (I stopped taking this after suspecting that it was contributing to
  my abdominal discomfort).

With the exception of the occasional Vitamin C supplement and
occasional Vitamin B Complex supplement, I have all of these with my
first meal of the day.

### Other one-off supplement consumption

Across late 2019, 2020, and 2021, I consumed a curcumin supplement
from a left-over bottle given by a friend to deal with occasional
inflammation issues (that happened once every few months). I used up
the bottle in August 2021 in its expiration month while addressing the
[2021-08-28 sore throat after
meals](../events/2021/2021-08-28-sore-throat-after-meals.md). I haven't bought
anything similar since then, since I haven't had similar inflammation
issues.

## Physical exercise

When feeling well, I do running/jogging almost-daily, strength
exercises about 3 times a week, and various balance/flexibility
exercises several times a week (between 3 and 7 times a week). I also
do hand gripper exercises and breath holds daily. When I am less well,
I may do a limited subset of these exercises, or reduce their
frequency or intensity.

I describe my exercise routine in more detail in
[exercise-routine.md](physical-exercise/exercise-routine.md). I record
my deviations from routine in an annual tracker file. For instance,
for 2024, see the [2024 exercise
tracker](../events/2024/2024-exercise-tracker.md).

My best practices around vaccinations, blood tests, and dental
cleanings include breaks from exercise of varying durations. The
magnitude of the break depends on the kind of activity. For instance,
for dental cleanings, I only break on the day of. On the other hand,
for blood tests, I break briefly from jogging for the prior day and
day of, whereas for vaccines, I break briefly from jogging for the
day of and next two days. Breaks from strength exercises are longer
for vaccines and blood tests due to their impact on arm strength. See
the [best-practices folder](../best-practices/) for more details.

### History of exercise

Daily jogging has been something I have tried to maintain throughout
my adult life, and I did something similar around age ten and then as
a teenager. My ability to adhere to that goal has fluctuated based on
weather conditions and time commitments.

The switch to working-from-home in March 2020 (with the COVID-19
pandemic) helped me be more regular with daily jogging, as there was
less need to get ready at a specific time to commute. After an
[injury](../events/2022/2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md) and
subsequently after moving my residence in April 2022, I increased the
length and consistency of my daily jogging distance, and also reduced
my peak jogging speed. See
[here](physical-exercise/jogging-and-return-walking-with-history.md)
for the progression.

I hadn't done weights or strength training as a regular part of my
routine as an adult until November 2021. I introduced it in November
2021 after purchasing dumb bells and an exercise mat. See
[here](physical-exercise/strength-exercises-with-history.md) for details of my
initial progession. This was also around the time that I introduced
pushups; I had introduced some balance exercises a little earlier.

I started hand gripper exercises in July 2023; see
[here](physical-exercise/hand-gripper-exercise-with-history.md) for
the progression.

See
[here](physical-exercise/standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed-with-history.md)
for the progression of my standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed
exercises; these started likely November 2021 or earlier, and I've
been systematic about recording milestones starting late October 2023.

I also started looking into Buteyko breathing in July 2023; eventually
this led me to start doing breath holds regularly; see
[here](physical-exercise/breath-holds-with-history.md) for some
background information.

## Cognitive exercise

In 2024, I started putting together a cognitive exercise regimen. The
exercises I am doing are mostly from [Human
Benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/). As of October 2024, some of
the exercises have clearly defined frequencies and goals, while others
are still experimental.

See [exercise-routine.md](../cognitive-exercise/exercise-routine.md)
for more details.

## Sleep

I go to sleep some time between 10:30 PM and 12:30 AM, depending on
how my work winds down as well as weather-related factors. I
occasionally go to sleep earlier (as early as 9:30 PM) or later (as
late as 3 AM).

While I do set an alarm to make sure I wake up in time for any
meetings or deliverables, my general goal is to wake up *before* the
alarm and to preemptively silence the alarm. On most days, I do
achieve this goal. My waking time can vary widely from 7 AM to 9 AM;
it depends a lot on when I go to sleep, whether I have a sleep backlog
from previous days, and the weather (I generally sleep in a bit more
if it's colder).

My average sleep duration is a little under 8 hours. When I am a
little less well but am still broadly functional, my sleep duration
may go up to about 9 hours.

I generally don't remember dreams when I wake up, but I sometimes do
have dreams that I remember.

For more on the practices I aspire to follow with respect to sleep,
see [here](../best-practices/best-practices-around-sleep.md).

### Historical sleep issues

In the early 2010s, I had issues with falling asleep, and experimented
with taking melatonin a few times to improve my sleep quality. I did
not find clear improvement (but did not test extensively enough to get
conclusive information). In any case, my sleep issues resolved
themselves over time. As of 2024, I don't have any ongoing sleep
issues (such as difficulty falling asleep, highly restless sleep,
etc.)

## Other routine elements

### Dental routine

* Brushing: Once in the morning, and once about 1-6 hours after each
  meal (earlier if I need to go out after the meal so I can't wait the
  1-6 hours). Total 3 times per day. I use a soft (manual, not
  electric) toothbrush and change it every 3 months.

* Saltwater rinse: Once after post-meal cleanup for each meal. Total 2
  times per day.

* Flossing with interdental brush: Once after post-meal cleanup for
  first meal of the day, before saltwater rinse. Total once per day. I
  use a given interdental brush for about 3 days.

* Flossing with pick on floss holder: Once after post-meal cleanup for
  second meal of the day, after saltwater rinse. Total once per day.

## Medications

I do not take any ongoing medications (except supplements; see
[supplements](#supplements)).

### Pain medication in stock

I keep in stock not-yet-expired:

* acetaminophen/paracetamol (the active ingredient in tylenol, though
  I don't necessary use the tylenol brand)
* ibuprofen

Though I keep pain medication in stock, I don't generally consume it,
and in most cases, I have to throw it after it expires.

### Past medication consumption

* 2024-04-25: I took a dose of acetaminophen to address my [2024-04-25
  abdominal pain](../events/2024/2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md).

* [2023-08-23 wisdom tooth removal (right
  side)](../events/2023/2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md#consumption-of-medications):
  I consumed a few doses of pain medication, specifically 1 dose of
  hydrocodone / acetaminophen and 2 doses of ibuprofen. This was much
  less than the prescribed amount, but taking the pain medication was
  optional. I did not want to take too much pain medication because in
  my experience, taking too much pain medication can also end up
  masking my fatigue and get in the way of me being able to process my
  body's signals.

* [2023-07-05 wisdom tooth removal (left
  side)](../events/2023/2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md#consumption-of-medications):
  I consumed 6 doses each of the antibiotic clindamycin, hydrocodone /
  acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. I had severe side-effects, likely from
  the consumption of the antibiotic. More details are in later
  sections of the linked doc.

* 2023-07-03: I took a test dose of acetaminophen in preparation for
  possibly needing to take it after my wisdom tooth removal. See
  [2023-07-03-acetaminophen-consumption.md](../events/2023/2023-07-03-acetaminophen-consumption.md)
  for more details.

I do not recall taking any non-supplement medication other than these
since 2018; I also don't recall taking non-supplement medication since
2014, though I might have taken some prior to 2018 that I don't
recall.

### Prescriptions that I did not consume

On 2024-04-30, in my [urgent care
visit](../events/2024/2024-04-30-urgent-care-visit-and-tests.md) in
response to my [abdomainal pain starting
2024-04-25](../events/2024/2024-04-25-abdominal-pain.md), I was
prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) called pantoprazole
(Protonix) with the direction to take up to once daily for
pain. However, based on my later pain trajectory and my research, I
decided not to take the PPI.

## Surgeries

### No surgeries other than dental procedures as an adult

As an adult (at least since I've turned 18) I haven't had any
surgeries, unless you count the wisdom tooth removal procedure
documented in my [dental status](#dental-status). For the wisdom tooth
removal procedure in 2023, as well as periodontal therapy in 2021, I
was administered local anesthetic. For the wisdom tooth removal, I was
also administered laughing gas. Other than these two procedures, I
have not received local anesthetic or laughing gas as an adult. I have
not been any sedation as an adult.

### Ear infection surgery as a child

When I was around 4 years old, I had surgery for my ear infection,
conducted by an ENT specialist.

### Wart removal as an older child

I had a wart above my upper lip as a child (I'm not sure exactly what
age). I had two attempted wart removal procedures, with the second one
being successful.

## Skin

My skin is on the dry side of the spectrum, so particularly in colder
climates, it can get cuts if not adequately cared for. I generally
apply vaseline lotion to my legs daily and to my hands (just the
hands, not the forearms) several times a day. With moderate care, I don't
have any noticeable skin issues.

## Aging

This section presents a picture of my aging from my mid-to-late
twenties to my mid-to-late thirties, with a particular focus on the
evolution in the later years, when I've been better at keeping track
of things.

Ways I seem to be stable with age:

* Resting vitals (heart rate, blood pressure): I don't have good
  historical measurements prior to mid-2023, as I did not have tools
  to measure heart rate and blood pressure at home. But based on the
  few measurements I got over the prior years, things do look roughly
  stable on these fronts.

* Eye health (roughly): There was a long gap from my previous eye
  checkup to the one in 2021, but my loose impression is that my eye
  health has roughly stayed the same.

* Baseline skin health (afaicmo) not accounting for better deliberate
  care steps: My skin has been on the dry side but the use of vaseline
  hydrating lotion has generally done the trick and prevented more serious issues.

* Total accounted-for hours (a rough measure of total realized
  capacity to do stuff) seems largely stable. It did go down in around
  mid-2023 after shifting to part-time work, and is now back up
  roughly to match original levels.

Ways I seem to be getting better with age:

* Crystallized intelligence / knowledge in general seem to be improving.

* Processes / protocols seem to be improving (around both how to
  prevent and respond to health things and to general life things).

* Short-run cognitive and physical strength and stamina seem to be
  improving in the areas where I do regular practice; haven’t noticed
  any clear trends in other areas. Regular practice with a focus on
  improvement only started around 2021 and picked up around 2023.

* Peak negatives (health issues, injuries, etc.) seem to be declining;
  when I do get injured or a health issue, it seems to be more
  minor. This is likely due to the better processes and protocols as
  mentioned above.

* Stress seems to be reducing, but this is likely mostly environmental
  (less sympathetic activation with working from home, reduced hours,
  less uncertainty-driven stress at work).

* Dental health is improving, thanks to improved dental practices
  including flossing, rinsing, and regular 6-month cleanings. The
  improvement happened starting 2021.

* Lipid profile may be improving, but more data is needed.

Ways I seem to be getting worse with age:

* Slow (but steady?) balding and graying. However, the rate of this
  doesn't seem unusually high relative to other males of my age.

* Low-grade subjective physical distress may be getting worse
  (starting April 2024), but this might be dominated by a couple of
  categories (GI tract issues).

* Recovery time from acute stresses may be increasing; I can’t subject
  myself to junk and recover the next day, but it’s not clear how good
  I was at recovering in the past, since I tend to record things more
  now (and also seem to be better — or luckier -- at avoiding acute
  stresses in the first place).

* Related to the above two, I might have increased “sensitivity” to
  minor things, which may be good and bad; the good side of the
  increased sensitivity is the ability to act before things get bad,
  the flip side is being distracted by it even when my ability to act
  is limited. Example: previously despite having relatively
  significant gum disease I didn’t really notice any gum pain except
  during acute flares, now I seem to notice the most minor thing with
  my teeth and gums and lips and cheek.
