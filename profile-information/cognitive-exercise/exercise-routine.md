# Exercise routine

This document is for my cognitive exercise routine. You can also see
my [physical exercise
routine](../physical-exercise/exercise-routine.md).

## Sequence memory

Goal of exercise: Maintain at 30+ score

Further information: [Human Benchmark sequence memory exercise with history](human-benchmark-sequence-memory-exercise-with-history.md)

My goal is to play sequence memory about once every two weeks and
maintain a score of 30+. I should play this on a weekend day when I am
not doing strength exercises and budget at least 25 minutes for the
exercise.

## Verbal memory

Goal of exercise: Build toward consistently scoring 150+

Further information: [Human Benchmark verbal memory exercise with
history](human-benchmark-verbal-memory-exercise-with-history.md)

My goal is to play verbal memory about three times per week until I
get to consistently scoring 150+. I should play this on days when I am
doing strength exercises, and should budget at least 10 minutes for
the exercise.

## Number memory

Goal of exercise: Build toward consistently scoring 20+

Further information: [[Human Benchmark number memory exercise with
history](human-benchmark-number-memory-exercise-with-history.md)

My goal is to play number memory about once every 1-2 weeks until I
can get to consistently scoring 20 or more.

## Chimp test

Goal of exercise: Build toward consistently scoring 20+

Further information: [Human Benchmark chimp test exercise with history](human-benchmark-chimp-test-exercise-with-history.md)

My goal is to play chimp test about 2-3 times per week till I can get
to consistently scoring 20 or more.

## Typing

Goal of exercise: Maintan average of 90 wpm+, try to build toward 150 wpm

Further information: [Human Benchmark typing exercise with history](human-benchmark-typing-exercise-with-history.md)

My goal is to do the typing exercise about 1-3 times a week and try to
improve, though I am not putting in any concerted effort toward
improvement.

## Other unincorporated exercises

See [Human Benchmark tracker](human-benchmark-tracker.md) for other
exercises for which I am still experimenting with the correct
frequency and figuring out my goals.
