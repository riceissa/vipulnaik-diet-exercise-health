# Human Benchmark tracker

This document is for notes on my performance on [human benchmark
tests](https://humanbenchmark.com/). I don't record all scores, just
summaries of my recent and cumulative trends periodically.

The following exercises have their own pages and have been removed
from this summary. Eventually all exercises should have their own
page:

* [Sequence memory](human-bechmark-sequence-memory-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Verbal memory](human-benchmark-verbal-memory-exercise-with-history.md)
* [Chimp test](human-benchmark-chimp-test-exercise-with-history.md)

## 2024-05-16

So far I've done four tests as logged-in user:

* Typing: 94 wpm, averaging two data points of 85 wpm and 102 wpm
  respectively. This places me at the 94.1th percentile. I have had
  previous practice with this test (before logging in) and obviously
  have a lot of practice typing in real life.

* Number memory: 14.0 points, with just one play at 14.0 points. This
  places me at the 96.2th percentile. Although I had not had recent
  practice of this test, it does mimic a lot of real-world stuff
  (notably, remembering 2FA tokens for data entry) so I think I do
  have prior practice of this in some sense.

## 2024-05-23: off-cycle update on single-handed typing

My single-handed typing speeds were 50 wpm for the left hand and 39
wpm for the right hand. Overall, this suggests that my two-handed
typing speed is close to the sum of my typing speeds with each hand
individually.

I've continued to do four tests as a logged-in user:

* Typing: 95 wpm moving average, placing me at the 94.1th
  percentile. The score values range from 70 wpm to 110 wpm.

* Number memory: 13.6 points moving average, placing me at the 96.2th
  percentle. My score ranges between 13 and 15.

* Visual memory: 9 points moving average over very few attempts,
  placing me at the 5.0th percentile. I am planning to do a lot of
  practice of this and move up to a consistently higher score.

## 2024-10-15

I've been doing more regular practice, and appear to have improved
quite a bit:

* Typing: 102 wpm moving average, placing me at the 97.2th
  percentile. My scores are generally in the 95-110 wpm range with
  occasional dips down to the 80s.

* Number memory: 13.6 points moving average, placing me at the 96.2th
  percentle. My score ranges between 13 and 15. There's no update
  since last month.

* Visual memory: 10.8 points moving average, placing me at the 40.5th
  percentile. The score distribution on the whole has 9 and 10 as
  modal values. I usually get to level 10 but only occasionally get
  past it to level 11. Very occasionally I fail to get to level 10. My
  highest level ever is 13, which may have been due to getting lucky
  with some patterns.

* Reaction time: 303 ms, placing me at the 7.3th percentile. This seems
  very hard to improve. I rarely get reaction times less than 230 ms,
  even in the best of times.

* Aim trainer: 721 ms, placing me at the 4.3th percentile. I expect to
  improve a little bit here with more practice, to at least get past
  the percentile for reaction time.
