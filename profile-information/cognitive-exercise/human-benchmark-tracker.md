# Human bemchmark tracker

This document is for notes on my performance on [human benchmark
tests](https://humanbenchmark.com/). I don't record all scores, just
summaries of my recent and cumulative trends periodically.

## 2024-05-16

So far I've done four tests as logged-in user:

* Typing: 94 wpm, averaging two data points of 85 wpm and 102 wpm
  respectively. This places me at the 94.1th percentile. I have had
  previous practice with this test (before logging in) and obviously
  have a lot of practice typing in real life.

* Sequence memory: 15.4 points, averaging across 19 plays; a modal
  around 17-19, and a max of 22. This places me at the 90.9th
  percentile. I have had a fair amount of practice with this test
  before logging in and creating an account; however, on the flip
  side, a few runs of the test, particularly the lower-scoring ones,
  were done in distracted settings.

* Verbal memory: 66.5 points, averaging 65 points and 68 points. This
  places me at the 77.72th percentile. Unlike the typing and sequence
  memory tests, I have not yet had practice with this test prior to
  these two plays.

* Number memory: 14.0 points, with just one play at 14.0 points. This
  places me at the 96.2th percentile. Although I had not had recent
  practice of this test, it does mimic a lot of real-world stuff
  (notably, remembering 2FA tokens for data entry) so I think I do
  have prior practice of this in some sense.

## 2024-05-23: off-cycle update on single-handed typing

My single-handed typing speeds were 50 wpm for the left hand and 39
wpm for the right hand. Overall, this suggests that my two-handed
typing speed is close to the sum of my typing speeds with each hand
individually.

## 2024-09-21

I've continued to do four tests as a logged-in user:

* Typing: 95 wpm moving average, placing me at the 94.1th
  percentile. The score values range from 70 wpm to 110 wpm.

* Sequence memory: 17.2 points moving average, placing me at the
  94.9th percentile. The score values range from 10 to 20, but with a
  few data points below 10 and a few above 20. My highest recorded
  score seems to be 29. My normal good score is in the 16-20 range.

* Verbal memory: 118.4 points moving average, placing me at the 95.0th
  percentile. My historical score range is between 40 and 160, but
  recent results have been on the higher end. This may be a case of a
  game where I have improved in game-specific ways.

* Number memory: 13.6 points moving average, placing me at the 96.2th
  percentle. My score ranges between 13 and 15.

* Visual memory: 9 points moving average over very few attempts,
  placing me at the 5.0th percentile. I am planning to do a lot of
  practice of this and move up to a consistently higher score.
