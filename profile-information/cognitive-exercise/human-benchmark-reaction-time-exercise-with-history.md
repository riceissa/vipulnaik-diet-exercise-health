# Human Benchmark reaction time exercise with history

(other sections to be filled in later)

## Performance history

* 2024-10-15: 303 ms, placing me at the 7.3th percentile. This seems
  very hard to improve. I rarely get reaction times less than 230 ms,
  even in the best of times.

* 2025-02-18: 276 ms moving average, placing me at at 11.31th
  percentile. Not much has changed qualitatively since the last update
  on 2024-10-15.

* 2025-02-21 (after I started getting more serious about it and did
  several rounds of practice): 248 ms moving average, placing me at
  the 32.89th percentile. I think I'm getting the knack of this more
  and hope to improve a bit more with practice.
