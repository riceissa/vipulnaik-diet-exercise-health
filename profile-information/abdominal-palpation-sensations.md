# Abdominal palpation sensations

Below is a glossary of sensations I have experienced.

## No special sensation (NSS)

Here, I experience no special sensation; I just notice that the area
was palpated.

## Pain zero (P0.0)

This is a case where I feel some kind of noteworthy sensation, but the
pain rating both before and after palpation, on a scale of 0 to 10
would be 0. In other words, it is not unpleasant per se.

The noteworthy sensation might be fullness, or some kind of tension
release, or just a sense that something is going on there.

## General pain rating (`Pa.b`) where a and b are both from 0 to 10

This is self-explanatory.
