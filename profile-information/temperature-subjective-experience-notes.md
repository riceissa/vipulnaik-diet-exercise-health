# Temperature subjective experience

These notes were last taken in 2022, but are approximately accurate as
of 2024-07-24.

There's a temperature measurement in my apartment, and I've been
observing how my subjective experience relates to measured
temperature.

The temperature measurement isn't super-granular; for instance, it
skips over some integer values of Fahrenheit measurement. It may also
have limited range at the high and low end.

Measured temperature in degrees Fahrenheit | Subjective sensation
-- | --
62 and less | I need to keep my sweatshirt on, and I feel a little cold in the legs when wearing shorts. If in bed, the coolness makes me feel a little reluctant to get out.
66 | I prefer to keep my sweatshirt on. I feel mildly cool but not to a point where it distracts me.
69 and 71 | These are transition temperatures where I have a slight preference for the sweatshirt, except if I've just exercised and am sweaty.
73 | I prefer to not keep the sweatshirt on, but don't mind too much if it's on.
75, 76 | I'm reasonably warm even without a sweatshirt.
78, 80 | I start to feel warm to the point where it is mildly distracting if the temperature is sustained for several hours.
84 | This is a temperature level that is distractingly hot even for a relatively brief duration. At this point, I have a preference for cold water bath / shower.
89, 93 | At this temperature, I might take active steps to cool down, such as washing my face frequently. I also need to take care of my devices and monitor their overheating.
