# 2024-05-21: unplanned 19-hour fast

## Timeline

### 2024-05-20 (prior day)

On the evening of 2024-05-20, I had dinner a little late, around 9:30
PM. I finished eating around 10:30 PM. This was due to a bunch of
things happening, as well as my decision to meal prep in anticipation
of it being difficult the next day.

### 2024-05-21 (day of fast and breaking thereof)

On 2024-05-21, I ended up having my first meal of the day at around
6:10 PM. The reason for the delay was that the planned stuff that I
was aware would happen ended up happening a little earlier than
anticipated, and continued longer than anticipated. Even when it
wrapped up (a little before 5 PM) there were a number of loose threads
I wanted to finish up before breaking for food. I got enough of the
key loose threads wrapped up by around 6 PM, so then I got ready and
had my first meal of the day.

I had a larger meal than usual and skipped a second meal. I went to
sleep a few minutes past 11 PM.

## 2024-05-22 (next day)

I woke up around 7 AM and had a normal morning (including a normal
bowel movement).

I felt a little soreness/tightness in my throat, somewhat similar
(though less intense) than in my [last unplanned
fast](2024-01-27-unplanned-22-hour-fast.md) (see
[here](2024-01-garlic-flavored-olive-oil-and-sore-throat.md)). At the
time, I attributed the soreness to a mix of the fast and
garlic-flavored olive oil; the smaller magnitude of soreness here
suggests that last time it was indeed a combination.
