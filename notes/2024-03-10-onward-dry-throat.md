# 2024-03-10 onward: dry throat

On 2024-03-10, after my dinner, I noticed that my throat was feeling
dry. I suspected that this was because of not having almond milk for
the last few days, and having excessive sauerkraut and walnuts. On
2024-03-10 evening, I had some almond milk even though I don't usually
have that separate from dinner. I also increased my water consumption.

Then, the next day, 2024-03-11, I skipped sauerkraut and walnuts and
had more almond milk. I didn't consciously experience the dry throat
for most of the day; however, it was clearly noticeable after
dinner. An aggravating factor might have been my extended mask use on
2024-03-11, for over 3 hours continuously.

I continued to drink more water than usual on the evening of
2024-03-11.

The dry throat continued to be noticeable (though not too distracting)
on the morning of 2024-03-12.
