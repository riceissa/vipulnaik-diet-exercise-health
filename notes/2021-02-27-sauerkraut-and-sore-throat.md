# Sauerkraut and sore throat

On February 27, 2021, I noticed that I had had a sore and dry throat
for a few days. The dietary factor that stood out most was that I had
been consuming huge amounts of sauerkraut since Sunday, February 21,
2021. Although not the only factor that might cause a sore throat (I
had also had a yellow curry, takeout spinach masala dosa from Udupi
Palace, and vegetable biriyanis), the sauerkraut stood out for the
huge quantity of its increase.

I plan to take a break from sauerkraut for a few days and also reduce
other foods that might aggravate a sore throat, before deciding the
right volume at which to return to these foods. Other than throat
issues I haven't had any dietary issues with these foods that I can
make out.
