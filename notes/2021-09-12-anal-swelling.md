# Anal swelling starting 2021-09-12

On the morning of 2021-09-12, after bowel movement, I felt a little
pain in my lower anus. I didn't think much of it. Later that day, a
toilet clog (for unrelated reasons) led to me needing to suppress
bowel and urine movements, which might have increased the pain. The
toilet clog was resolved the afternoon of Monday 2021-09-13.

For most of Monday and Tuesday, I would experience a slight pain
whenever contracting the relevant muscles, which generally happened
during major posture changes (sitting to standing). While engaging in
a specific activity, such as sitting, standing, walking, or running,
pain was infrequent and minimal.

On inspection, there was a slight swelling/injury. I'm applying lotion
regularly and will investigate further if the situation does not
improve in a few days.

## Possible causes and aggravating factors

* Spicy food from Mehak Indian Cuisine on 2021-09-11, more than usual.
* Suppression of urine and bowel nmovements due to toilet clog.
