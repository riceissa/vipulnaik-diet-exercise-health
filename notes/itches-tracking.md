A friend asked me to record when and how I had itches, to get a
general measurement of how often people feel itchy. I'm doing this for
a week.

The recording isn't necessarily comprehensive, as sometimes I scratch
an itch without even consciously thinking about it. This might also
explain why the number of recordings reduced over the days. But it
could also be that I imagined itches in the earlier days because I was
more primed to tracking them.
