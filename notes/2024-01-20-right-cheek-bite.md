# 2024-01-20: right cheek bite

On 2024-01-20, while having food in the evening, I accidentally bit
down against my right cheek. The bite felt minor, and I didn't need to
take any action, though I did take care to avoid that area for the
rest of my meal and my next few meals.

On 2024-01-21, while flossing, I did notice a little bit of sensation
in the area, but it wasn't notably painful. I will avoid stimulating
the area (e.g., by tongue probing) and monitor for whether the pain
gets worse before its gets better.
