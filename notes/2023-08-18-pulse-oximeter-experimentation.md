# 2023-08-18: pulse oximeter experimentation

On 2023-08-18, I got a pulse oximeter. I played a little bit with
it. Here are some things I found.

## Seated rest

* The pulse oximeter takes about 30 seconds to get to a stable range
  of values for heart rate (bpm). It seems like it generally starts at
  a higher value of around 67-71 bpm and gradually goes down. The
  stable value while I am seated seems to fluctate between 57 and 65
  bpm.

* The SpO2 value stays around 97% throughout.

## Control pause

When I block my nose for the duration of control pause for Buteyko
breathing, my SpO2 gradually drops from 97% to about 94-95%. When I
release my nose, it gradually goes back up, but in fact seems to shoot
past 97% to 98%-99%. It then goes back down to about 97% over time.
