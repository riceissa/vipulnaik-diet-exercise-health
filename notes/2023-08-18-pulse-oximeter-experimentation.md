# 2023-08-18: pulse oximeter experimentation

On 2023-08-18, I got a pulse oximeter. I played a little bit with
it. This shows continuous real-time readings for SpO2 (%) and heart
rate (in bpm). Here are some things I found.

## Seated rest

### First take

* SpO2: The SpO2 value stays around 97% throughout.

* Heart rate (bpm): The pulse oximeter takes about 30 seconds to get
  to a stable range of values for heart rate (bpm) (this is consistent
  with what the documentation in its manual says). It seems like it
  generally starts at a higher value of around 67-71 bpm and gradually
  goes down. The stable value while I am seated seems to fluctate
  between 57 and 65 bpm.

### Second take

* SpO2: The SpO2 value stays around 97%, going up to 98% and down to
  96% sometimes.

* Heart rate (bpm) After starting at 65, the heart rate stabilizes in
  the 53-59 bpm range.

## Control pause

### First take

* SpO2: When I block my nose for the duration of control pause for
  Buteyko breathing, my SpO2 gradually drops from 97% to about
  94-95%. When I release my nose, it gradually goes back up, but in
  fact seems to shoot past 97% to 98%-99%. It then goes back down to
  about 97% over time.

* Heart rate (bpm): My heart rate stays within the 57-65 bpm range.

### Second take

* SpO2: This drops from 97% to 96% and then 95% at around the
  30-second mark of holding my breath. After I unblock, it further
  drops to 94, 93, and then 92 before rebounding to 96% and then
  eventually climbing to 98% before settling back at 97%.

* Heart rate (bpm): My heart rate starts at 53-59 bpm. It drops briefly
  to 46-51 bpm (near the end of my control pause) before rebounding to
  53-59.
