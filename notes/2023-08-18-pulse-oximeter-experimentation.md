# 2023-08-18: pulse oximeter experimentation

On 2023-08-18, I got a pulse oximeter. I played a little bit with
it. This shows continuous real-time readings for SpO2 (%) and heart
rate (in bpm). Here are some things I found.

## Take 1: night on 2023-08-18 (shortly after eating)

### Seated rest

This is a blended average observation across a few readings:

* SpO2: The SpO2 value stayed around 97% throughout.

* Heart rate (bpm): The pulse oximeter took about 30 seconds to get to
  a stable range of values for heart rate (bpm) (this is consistent
  with what the documentation in its manual says). It seems like it
  generally started at a higher value of around 67-71 bpm and
  gradually went down. The stable value while I was seated seemed to
  fluctate between 57 and 65 bpm.

### Breath hold for about 25-35 seconds

* SpO2: When I blocked my nose for the duration of control pause for
  Buteyko breathing, my SpO2 gradually dropped from 97% to about
  94-95%. When I released my nose, it gradually went back up, but in
  fact seems to shoot past 97% to 98%-99%. It then goes back down to
  about 97% over time.

* Heart rate (bpm): My heart rate stayed within the 57-65 bpm range.

## Take 2: night on 2023-08-18 (over an hour after eating)

### Seated rest

* SpO2: The SpO2 value stayed around 97%, going up to 98% and down to
  96% sometimes.

* Heart rate (bpm) After starting at 65 bpm, the heart rate stabilized
  in the 53-59 bpm range.

### Breath hold for about 25-35 seconds

* SpO2: This dropped from 97% to 96% and then 95% at around the
  30-second mark of holding my breath. After I unblocked, it further
  dropped in the next few seconds to 94, 93, and then 92 before
  rebounding to 96% and then eventually climbing to 98% before
  settling back at 97%.

* Heart rate (bpm): My heart rate started at 53-59 bpm. It drops
  briefly to 46-51 bpm (near the end of my control pause) before
  rebounding to 53-59.

## Take 3: morning on 2023-08-19 a few minutes after waking up

### Seated rest

* SpO2: The SpO2 values stayed at 99%.

* Heart rate (bpm) started at 49 bpm and stabilized in the 49-54 bpm range.

### Breath hold for about 25-35 seconds

* SpO2: This stayed at 99% throughout the exercise.

* Heart rate (bpm): My heart rate started in the 49-54 bpm range and
  went up to the 54-59 bpm range briefly during the breath hold before
  returning to normal.

## Take 4: after coming back from jogging and before eating on 2023-08-19

### Seated rest

A few minutes after I returned from my jogging + walking back (with
occasional jogging on the return journey), I took my readings again.

* SpO2: The SpO2 started at 96% and went up to 97% after about a
  minute.

* Heart rate (bpm): The heart rate started in the 76-82 bpm
  range. After about a minute it was down to a 71-78 bpm range.

I did not do a breath hold exercise this time.

## Take 5: shortly after eating on 2023-08-19

### Seated rest

This was a few minutes after finishing post-eating cleanup.

* SpO2: This was mostly at 97% but with the occasional fluctuation to
  98% and 96%.

* Heart rate (bpm): This stayed mostly in the 55-65 bpm range, with
  one upward fluctuation to about 80 bpm when I burped.

### Standing (while continually having the pulse oximeter on)

* SpO2: This stayed around 97%.

* Heart rate (bpm): This was highly variable, between 65 and 85 bpm,
  but for the most part was in the range of 70 to 80 bpm.
