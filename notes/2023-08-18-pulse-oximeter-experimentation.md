# 2023-08-18: pulse oximeter experimentation

On 2023-08-18, I got a pulse oximeter. I played a little bit with
it. This shows continuous real-time readings for SpO2 (%) and heart
rate (in bpm). Here are some things I found.

## Seated rest

* SpO2: The SpO2 value stays around 97% throughout.

* Heart rate (bpm): The pulse oximeter takes about 30 seconds to get
  to a stable range of values for heart rate (bpm) (this is consistent
  with what the documentation in its manual says). It seems like it
  generally starts at a higher value of around 67-71 bpm and gradually
  goes down. The stable value while I am seated seems to fluctate
  between 57 and 65 bpm.

## Control pause

* SpO2: When I block my nose for the duration of control pause for
  Buteyko breathing, my SpO2 gradually drops from 97% to about
  94-95%. When I release my nose, it gradually goes back up, but in
  fact seems to shoot past 97% to 98%-99%. It then goes back down to
  about 97% over time.

* Heart rate (bpm): My heart rate stays within the 57-65 bpm range.
