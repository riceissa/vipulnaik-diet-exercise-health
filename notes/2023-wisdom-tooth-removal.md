# 2023 wisdom tooth removal

This document includes notes related to the planning and execution of
my 2023 wisdom tooth removal. The latest dental opinion I received on
the subject can be found in the [2022-12-21 dental cleaning
notes](2022-12-21-dental-cleaning.md).

## Plan for appointment time and details prior to booking appointment

### One side at a time

I currently plan to get the two sides removed in separate
procedures. My reasons for this are as follows:

* Since I live alone and have limited dietary flexibility, doing one
  side at a time reduces the need for radical dietary adjustments each
  time.

* It also reduces the chances of things going really wrong.

I haven't decided which side to do first. It probably doesn't
matter. Let's say left first, barring any new information.

### Sedative use?

I'm still debating whether to take a sedative. I probably will take a
sedative as it makes the operation more comfortable for me.

Some online guidance on the subject:

* [SHOULD I GO UNDER FOR MY WISDOM TEETH REMOVAL OR STAY AWAKE?](https://www.keemsmile.com/should-i-go-under-for-my-wisdom-teeth-removal-or-stay-awake)
* [Sedation Options for Wisdom Teeth Extractions](https://www.absolutedental.com/blog/sedation-options-for-wisdom-teeth-extractions/#:~:text=Is%20Sedation%20Necessary%20for%20Wisdom,local%20anesthesia%20before%20the%20surgery.)

### Timing constraints

Here are some thoughts:

* I'd like to choose a time that is not otherwise busy or packed. As
  of now, July seems the earliest.

* I want to choose a time when it's moderately warm, as my caloric
  needs are higher in colder times, and the soft/liquid foods I've
  found so far are not that high on calories. May to September seems
  like a good time range for this.

* I also want to choose a time when it's not raining much, as I
  anticipate I may need to make more grocery store trips for food
  experimentation. May to September again seems like a good time for
  this.

### Constraints for gap between operations

[Healthline
article](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-does-it-take-the-hole-to-close-after-tooth-extraction)
gives a timeframeo f 6 weeks for close-to-full-healing of surgically
extracted teeth, including wisdom teeth. Therefore, a 6-week gap
between extractions seems reasonable.

### First operation around July, second operation around August, dental cleaning deferred to September

* I'd like to do the first phase of removal (left side) around July,
  by which time I expect to be caught up with the most time-sensitive
  portions of my backlog.

* Also, if possible, I'd like to do the second phase of removal around
  August, about 6 weeks after my first appointment.

* I'd like to defer my regular dental cleaning appointment to
  September, about 6 weeks after the second appointment.

## Plan for pre- and post-operation measures

### Preparatory measures in the week before the operation

Make sure that my food purchases are in line with the plans. In
particular:

### Medicine to stock up on

* Tylenol
* Ibuprofen

### Food to stock up on

* Miso ginger broth
* Tomato soup
* Almond milk
* Potatoes
* Regular mixed vegetable components, excluding carrots

### Food to not build excess stocks for prior to operation

* Peas (assume I won't have for 1 week after operation)
* Carrots (assume I won't have for 2 weeks after operation)
* Tortillas (assume I won't have for 2 weeks after operation)
* Nuts (assume I won't have for 3 weeks after operation)
* Sauerkraut (assume I won't have for 3 weeks after operation)

### Pre-operation diet plan

#### Find out if there are any pre-operation diet restrictions

Some sedatives may require me to not eat for some time before the
operation. Since I don't plan to eat for a while after the operation
either, I should find out the details.

### Post-operation dental care guidance

#### Brushing

Some general guidance:

* [HOW TO BRUSH TEETH AFTER WISDOM TOOTH EXTRACTION](https://bafdentistry.com/blogs/news/how-to-brush-teeth-after-wisdom-tooth-extraction)
* [Tips for Brushing Your Teeth After Wisdom Teeth Removal](https://drnathanielchan.com/tips-for-brushing-your-teeth-after-wisdom-teeth-removal#:~:text=On%20the%20same%20day%20of,right%20after%20wisdom%20tooth%20extraction.)

The general guidance seems to be to not brush teeth for 24 hours after
wisdom tooth removal, and then after that to brush manually (without
an electric toothbrush) and with care to be particularly gentle when
near the extraction site.

#### Rinsing

Similar to the case of brushing, rinsing is not advised for the first
24 hours after wisdom tooth removal. Even after that, avoid vigorous
rinsing and avoid spitting out excess water, as this might dislodge
the blood clot.

#### Flossing

While some of the guidance above suggests waiting 24 hours to start
flossing, [other
guidance](https://www.wacosurgicalarts.com/post/flossing-after-wisdom-teeth-extraction-yes-or-no)
recommends 48 hours.

### Post-operation diet plan

Some general guidance:

* [What to Eat After You Get Your Wisdom Teeth
  Out](https://www.dentisteorleans.ca/site/blog/2020/02/12/what-to-eat-after-you-get-your-wisdom-teeth-out)

* [The Best (and Worst) Foods to Eat After Wisdom Teeth
  Removal](https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/dental-care/eating-before-after-wisdom-teeth-removal)

#### Fast for the first 24 hours after wisdom tooth removal

Given the significant restrictions on whoat I can eat as well as the
restrictions against brushing, rinsing, and flossing, it may be best
to fast for about 24 hours after the wisdom tooth removal.

#### Liquid foods and soft foods for the first 5 days

I've been investigating liquid foods and soft foods that I can
have during the recovery phase. Here is my progress so far:

Liquid foods:

* Almond milk from Trader Joe's (some fat, protein, and vitamins, low
  on calories): I've been having this for a while (since 2019), and it
  is fine.

* Organic Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup (some vitamins and
  minerals, low on calories): I first bought this on 2023-01-21 and
  have been enjoying it. I've found it a good way too carry me through
  one or two meals as my previous batch of cooked food ends and I
  haven't had time for a new batch of cooked food.

* Miso ginger broth from Trader Joe's (low on calories): I first
  bought this on 2023-02-25 and tried it out on 2023-02-27. I've
  enjoyed it so far.

* Dal soup from Mehak Indian Cuisine (more protein, moderate on
  calories): Although liquid enough, this may be a bit more spicy to
  be used against fragile teeth.

Soft foods:

* Mashed potatoes: I need to figure out the right method of home
  preparation for these, to the extent possible. NOTE: I have prepared
  sliced potatoes, not quite mashed potatoes, but that might be fine
  enough for the purpose as long as I wait at least 24 hours before
  eating anything.

* My regular mixed vegetables are fine as long as I exclude carrots

I still need to explore food that is richer in carbohydrates and also
liquid or soft enough. Ideas include crushed or liquid rice and mashed
potatoes.

After adding a few more foods, I should do some calculations on the
caloric and nutrient values of the foods so that I can explore the
idea of sticking to that diet for a few weeks even if I can't have
other kinds of food (such as tortillas or my usual mixed vegetables)
*at all* over the period.

#### Preferences for the first 1-2 weeks

I'll try to get more rice from outside rather than have tortillas
since rice is a little easier to chew.

It is also recommended to avoid using straws as the suction can
dislodge blood clots.

#### Foods to avoid for about 3 weeks after the surgery

* Carrots (hard and can't be chewed, need to be bitten)
* Nuts
* Sauerkraut (very acidic)

### Risk of dry socket

Dry socket means that the blood clot either doesn't happen or is
dislodged after wisdom tooth extraction.

Guidance:

* [Dry Socket - Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17731-dry-socket)
* [Dry Socket - Mayo Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17731-dry-socket)

The precautions described in the preceding sections regarding
post-operation dental care and post-operation diet should reduce the
risk of dry socket. However, there's still some nontrivial risk, so
here are the precuationary / responsive measures.

#### Preferentially book the appointment for Wednesday or earlier

Since the risk of dry socket is highest in the 1-2 days after the
wisdom tooth extraction, booking the appointment earlier increases the
chances that it'll be a weekday when dry socket develops, which makes
it easier to access dental care (dental offices will be open at the
time).

#### Have Tylenol and Ibuprofen handy and take it in case the pain is unbearable

The Tylenol I have at home has expired, so I need to get a new batch
of tylenol. I should also get ibuprofen. I might also explore trying a
small dose of both in advance to check if I have any adverse reactions
to either medication.

#### Contact the dental office in case of suspected dry socket

This is self-explanatory.

#### Try not to book any appointments (personal or work-related) for 5 days after the surgery

This minimizes risk and maximizes flexibility of time in case I need
to work on my dry socket.

## Questions to ask when booking the appointment

### Scheduling

* I'd like to schedule my left side only first.

* I prefer a time between Monday and Wednesday. Is that possible?

* I'd like to schedule my second appointment for about 6 weeks after
  my first appointment. The same day-of-week constraint (Monday to
  Wednesday) applies. Is that possible?

* I'd like to defer my regular dental cleaning appointment to about 6
  weeks after my second appointment. Wednesday is my preferred day. Is
  that psosible?

### Flexibility for rescheduling

* What is the advance notice needed for rescheduling each appointment?

* In general, how much in advance do I need to book an appointment?

### Operation process

* I'd like to get a (mild) sedative in addition to local anasthesia,
  if recommended. What sedative will it be, what will the cost be, and
  are there any pre-operation instructions (e.g., not to eat food for
  x hours before the operation)?

* Are there any recommendations for post-operation diet and dental care?

* What is the recommendation in case of pain at the extraction site,
  or dry socket, etc.? What medications are recommended for me to keep
  in stock, if any? At what threshold of pain should I reach out to
  the dental office?
