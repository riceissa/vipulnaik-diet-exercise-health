# 2023 wisdom tooth removal

This document includes notes related to the planning and execution of
my 2023 wisdom tooth removal. The latest dental opinion I received on
the subject can be found in the [2022-12-21 dental cleaning
notes](2022-12-21-dental-cleaning.md).

## Current plan

### One side at a time

I currently plan to get the two sides removed in separate
procedures. My reasons for this are as follows:

* Since I live alone and have limited dietary flexibility, doing one
  side at a time reduces the need for radical dietary adjustments each
  time.

* It also reduces the chances of things going really wrong.

I haven't decided which side to do first. It probably doesn't
matter. Let's say left first, barring any new information.

### Sedative use?

I'm still debating whether to take a sedative. I probably will take a
sedative as it makes the operation more comfortable for me.

Some online guidance on the subject:

### First operation around May

I'd like to do the first phase of removal around May, by which time I
expect to be caught up with the most time-sensitive portions of my
backlog. Depending on the experience with that operation, I'll figure
out when to get my second operation.

### Timing constraints

Here are some thoughts:

* I'd like to choose a time that is not otherwise busy or packed. As
  of now, May seems the earliest.

* I want to choose a time when it's moderately warm, as my caloric
  needs are higher in colder times, and the soft/liquid foods I've
  found so far are not that high on calories. May to September seems
  like a good time range for this.

* I also want to choose a time when it's not raining much, as I
  anticipate I may need to make more grocery store trips for food
  experimentation. May to September again seems like a good time for
  this.

### Post-operation diet plan

Some general guidance:

I've been investigating liquid foods and soft foods that I can
have during the recovery phase. Here is my progress so far:

Liquid foods:

* Almond milk from Trader Joe's (some fat, protein, and vitamins, low
  on calories): I've been having this for a while (since 2019), and it
  is fine.

* Organic Tomato and Roasted Red Pepper Soup (some vitamins and
  minerals, low on calories): I first bought this on 2023-01-21 and
  have been enjoying it. I've found it a good way too carry me through
  one or two meals as my previous batch of cooked food ends and I
  haven't had time for a new batch of cooked food.

* Miso ginger broth from Trader Joe's (low on calories): I first
  bought this on 2023-02-25 and tried it out on 2023-02-27. I've
  enjoyed it so far.

* Dal soup from Mehak Indian Cuisine (more protein, moderate on
  calories): Although liquid enough, this may be a bit more spicy to
  be used against fragile teeth.

I still need to explore food that is richer in carbohydrates and also
liquid or soft enough. Ideas include crushed or liquid rice and mashed
potatoes.

After adding a few more foods, I should do some calculations on the
caloric and nutrient values of the foods so that I can explore the
idea of sticking to that diet for a few weeks even if I can't have
other kinds of food (such as tortillas or my usual mixed vegetables)
*at all* over the period.
