# 2024-05-31 onward: greenish urine notied after Super B Complex supplementation

On 2024-05-31, in one round of urination about two hours after having
dinner with a Super B Complex supplement, I noticed that my urine was
yellowish-green (the more descriptive term for the color is
"neon-yellow" or "neon yellow") instead of the usual
yellowish-white. This is the first time in recent memory that I have
noticed this urine color. I noticed but didn't take any immediate
investigative action. The next urine was normal in appearance.

On 2024-06-02, I took a Super B Complex supplement with my morning
meal. The two rounds of urination immediately after that were normal;
however, one round of urination a little over two hours later was
greenish. My suspicion is therefore that the Super B Complex
supplement is driving the greenish color.

[This
article](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a42448461/why-is-my-pee-green/)
confirms that green urine can be caused by a Vitamin B supplement if
it has way more riboflavin (Vitamin B2) than the body needs, so that
the excess gets flushed out in the urine making the urine
green. However, the current version of the [linked Mayo Clinic article
used as a
citation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urine-color/symptoms-causes/syc-20367333)
doesn't seem to back it up.

Here's a [thing from UW
Medicine](https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/well/health/what-color-your-pee-says-about-your-health#:~:text=High%2Ddose%20vitamins%20can%20turn,is%20mixing%20with%20your%20pee.)
confirming the same thing. The color is described as "neon yellow" and
doesn't use the term "green".
