(see the Exercise plans section for plans and the Exercise section for

For my right side wisdom tooth removal on Wednesday August 23, I took
a planned break from exercise. My stopping of all exercise started
Monday August 21, two days before the procedure, and continued till
Monday August 28.

On Tuesday August 29, I resumed some mild exercises
(standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed, hand gripper, flexibility
exercises, and Buteyko breath hold.

On Monday September 4, I went jogging for the first time since
stopping. I took a break on Tuesday September 5, and then starting
Wednesday September 6 I resumed my full normal routine including
jogging and strength exercises (weights and pushups).

## 2023-09-20 to 2023-09-23: break from exercise due to air quality issues

More details: [2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md](2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md)

Berkeley experienced air quality issues from the afternoon of
2023-09-19 to the evening of 2023-09-23. I had already finished my jog
on the morning of 2023-09-19 prior to the air quality issues. For
2023-09-20 to 2023-09-23, I skipped jogging, strength exercises, as
well as other exercises to keep my breathing needs to a minimum.

## 2023-09-25 to 2023-09-27: break from running and strength exercises due to dental cleaning appointment

## 2023-09-28: halved run, with running both ways

I had limited time for my run as I needed to return for a meeting. So
I did a half-run, but ran both forward and back, so that my total
distance run was similar to the usual distance.

## 2023-10-03: skipped run because it was getting late and the afternoon is hot

I was wrapping up some work-related items and then needed to make a
trip to the post office. By the time I got back, it was starting to
get hot, and not ideal for my run. It was also late and I needed to
wrap up other things. Since I'll be out a bunch tomorrow for my eye
exam, I decided to skip jogging.

## 2023-10-04: skipped run due to eye exam

I skipped my run this morning as I had an eye exam in the afternoon;
see [2023-10-04-eye-exam.md](2023-10-04-eye-exam.md) for details.

## 2023-10-05: skipped run due to missing the cool time window

On 2023-10-05, I skipped my run as I wasn't able to go for the run
during the time window when it was still cool, due to some morning
tasks and meetings. By the time these were done. the temperature was
too high.
