## 2023-08-21 to 2023-09-05: break from exercise (with some resumption toward the end) due to wisdom tooth removal

More details:
[2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md](2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md)
(see the Exercise plans section for plans and the Exercise section for
what actually happened)

For my right side wisdom tooth removal on Wednesday August 23, I took
a planned break from exercise. My stopping of all exercise started
Monday August 21, two days before the procedure, and continued till
Monday August 28.

On Tuesday August 29, I resumed some mild exercises
(standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed, hand gripper, flexibility
exercises, and Buteyko breath hold.

On Monday September 4, I went jogging for the first time since
stopping. I took a break on Tuesday September 5, and then starting
Wednesday September 6 I resumed my full normal routine including
jogging and strength exercises (weights and pushups).

## 2023-09-20 to 2023-09-23: break from exercise due to air quality issues

More details: [2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md](2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md)

Berkeley experienced air quality issues from the afternoon of
2023-09-19 to the evening of 2023-09-23. I had already finished my jog
on the morning of 2023-09-19 prior to the air quality issues. For
2023-09-20 to 2023-09-23, I skipped jogging, strength exercises, as
well as other exercises to keep my breathing needs to a minimum.

## 2023-09-25 to 2023-09-27: break from running and strength exercises due to dental cleaning appointment

See [here](2023-09-27-dental-cleaning.md#exercise-plans) for details.

## 2023-09-28: halved run, with running both ways

I had limited time for my run as I needed to return for a meeting. So
I did a half-run, but ran both forward and back, so that my total
distance run was similar to the usual distance.

## 2023-10-03: skipped run because it was getting late and the afternoon is hot

I was wrapping up some work-related items and then needed to make a
trip to the post office. By the time I got back, it was starting to
get hot, and not ideal for my run. It was also late and I needed to
wrap up other things. Since I'll be out a bunch tomorrow for my eye
exam, I decided to skip jogging.

## 2023-10-04: skipped run due to eye exam

I skipped my run this morning as I had an eye exam in the afternoon;
see [2023-10-04-eye-exam.md](2023-10-04-eye-exam.md) for details.

## 2023-10-05: skipped run due to missing the cool time window

On 2023-10-05, I skipped my run as I wasn't able to go for the run
during the time window when it was still cool, due to some morning
tasks and meetings. By the time these were done. the temperature was
too high.

## 2023-10-05 to 2023-10-07: skipped strength exercises

On 2023-10-05, I skipped strength exercises along with skipping my run
(I generally do strength exercises after returning from my run as I'm
warmed up). On 2023-10-06 and 2023-10-07, I did go for my run;
however, due to the heat I was exhausted by the time I returned, so I
skipped strength exercises.

I aim to do strength exercises once every two days and record skips
starting the third or fourth consecutive day of skipping. In this
case, I had already skipped strength exercises on 2023-10-03 and
2023-10-04 as noted above.

## 2023-10-09: halved run (running both ways) due to probability of rain

On 2023-10-09, the probability of rain was around 15%, so instead of
taking the full run I took a halved run, but ran a large part of both
ways, so that my total running distance was comparable to my usual
running distance.

## 2023-10-14 to 2023-10-20: break from strength exercises

Between 2023-10-14 and 2023-10-20, I took a break from strength
exercises (except the hand gripper exercise, that I continued to do)
due to slight soreness after my [flu
shot](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/notes/2023-10-13-flu-shot.md)
and in order to reduce the risk of exacerbating that soreness. I
resumed strength exercises (weights and pushups) on 2023-10-21.

## 2023-10-20: halved run (running both ways) due to time crunch

On 2023-10-20, I needed to get back for a meeting, so I took a halved
run, but ran a large part of both ways, so that my total running
distance was comparable to my usual running distance.

## 2023-10-22: halved run (running both ways) due to probability of rain

On 2023-10-22, the probability of rain was around 15%, so instead of
taking the full run I took a halved run, but ran a large part of both
ways, so that my total running distance was comparable to my usual
running distance.

## 2023-11-02: halved run (running both ways) due to time crunch

On 2023-11-02, I needed to get back for a meeting, so I took a halved
run, but ran a large part of both ways, so that my total running
distance was comparable to my usual running distance.

Although in principle I could have gone for my run earlier, the lower
morning temperatures led me to wait a bit before going to run, and I
couldn't choose the exactly optimal time as I needed to be at a
logical stopping point with work.

## 2023-11-06: skipped run due to recent rain (so wet sidewalks) and ongoing probability of rain

On 2023-11-06, I skipped my run due to recent rain and wet sidewalks,
as well as the moderately high ongoing probability of rain. This also
effectively serves as a knee rest day, as it appears I haven't skipped
my run for over 30 days so far.

## 2023-11-09: halved run (running both ways) due to time crunch

On 2023-11-09, I needed to get back for a meeting, so I took a halved
run, but ran a large part of both ways, so that my total running
distance was comparable to my usual running distance.

I had been planning to go for my run a little earlier, but a few
things came up and I decided to stay on to resolve them. Even with the
later time, I had some buffer to get back to the meeting, but decided
to play it safe with a halved run.

## 2023-11-13: skipped run due to scheduling constraints

On Monday 2023-11-13, I couldn't go for my run in the morning due to
an extended time-sensitive meeting. My plan at the time was to go in
the afternoon/evening. However, by the time I had wrapped things up
well enough to be able to step away, it was already past sunset, and
so I decided it's better to skip.

## 2023-11-15: skipped strength exercises due to time constraints

I returned from jogging around 9:30 AM and had a meeting at 10 AM, and
I was planning to do strength exercises in the 30 minutes in
between. However, a bunch of work-related stuff came up and I wasn't
able to do strength exercises in those 30 minutes. The meeting went
for very long, and once it had ended I needed to eat, so I ended up
not getting any suitable time for strength exercise that day.

This was my scheduled strength exercise day (Wednesday); my previous
strength exercise day had been Sunday. I generally aim for Wednesday,
Friday, and Sunday for strength exercise.

## 2023-11-18: skipped run due to overnight rain resulting in wet sidewalks

I skipped my run on this day due to overnight rain resulting in wet
sidewalks. There is also a nontrivial probability of further rain,
though it's not high enough in and of itself.

## 2023-11-22: skipped run and strength exercises due to planned outside trip with lots of walking

I'm planning to walk extensively during an outside trip later today,
so I'm skipping my run and strength exercises in order to conserve my
energy.

## 2023-11-22: natural exercise

In total, I walked about 7 miles for about 2.5 hours spent walking,
out of a total of about 5 hours spent continuously standing and/or
walking. This included standing in BART for two journeys of about 30
minutes each, without holding on to any support. The walking also
included a fair amount of uphill and downhill walking, and included a
stretch of about 1 hour 45 minutes of walking with no pauses longer
than 2-3 minutes. Overall, this was a good real-world test of stamina
(the length of walking and standing), aerobic exercise (the length of
walking, including uphill and downhill walking), and balance +
reflexes (standing in BART for two journeys of about 30 minutes each
without holding any support).

## 2023-11-26 onward: switch to afternoon for running

Starting 2023-11-26, I made the switch to afternoon running, in light
of morning temperatures being low enough that it's preferable to
exercise in the afternoon.

## 2023-11-27: halved run due to time crunch

On 2023-11-27, I halved my run, but ran most of both ways, so the
overall distance I ran was comparable with my usual.

## 2023-11-29: natural exercise

I made a trip to San Francisco. This involved standing and a bit of
walking for about 2 hours 50 mintues and then again for about 40
minutes, with a 30-minute sitdown for eating in between. The standing
was in BART (where I had to balance while the train was moving) and
waiting at station platforms, including a one-hour wait due to a BART
holdup. The walking around was on the station platform, to and from
stations, and within Westfield Mall. Moreover, all my standing/walking
time involved wearing a mask, which added to the extent of natural
exercise.

The extensive natural exercise took the place of deliberate exercise
on this day.

## 2023-12-02: truncated run due to drizzle

On Saturday 2023-12-02, it wasn't raining when I started my run, but
it started drizzling lightly a minute or two into it, so I had to
truncate my run and return home.

## 2023-12-06: halved run (running both ways) due to probability of rain

On 2023-12-06, due to a small but nonneglible probability of rain
(~10%), I did a halved run, running both ways. As the sidewalks and
roads were wet from overnight rain, I ran a bit more slowly and
carefully than usual.

## 2023-12-09: skipped run due to natural exercise

On 2023-12-09, as I went out for two trips, I walked a decent amount
and was a bit fatigued, so I skipped my run.

## 2023-12-17: skipped run due to short time window with low probability of rain

On Sunday 2023-12-17, there was just a time window of about 2.5 hours
with low enough probability of rain, and I needed to do a shopping
trip in that time, so I skipped my run.

## 2023-12-18: halved run (running both ways) plus slower-than-usual running due to nontrivial probability of rain and wet sidewalks

On Monday 2023-12-18, the probability of rain in the afternoon was
high, and the probability in the morning was nontrivial enough that it
was okay for a halved run but not for the full run. So I took a halved
run and ran both ways. Also, the roads and sidewalks were wet with a
lot of fallen leaves on them, so I had to run more slowly and even
switch to a walk for some segments of my run.

## 2023-12-19 and 2023-12-20: skipped run due to nontrivial probability of rain and wet sidewalks

On Tuesday 2023-12-19 and Wednesday 2023-12-20, I skipped my run due
to a nontrivial probability of rain, and fairly wet sidewalks. There
were periods within the day when the probability of rain was low
enough that I could have gone running, but these were brief and
intermittent and didn't align with my schedule for the day.

## 2023-12-21 and 2023-12-22: skipped strength exercises

On 2023-12-21, I had strength exercises due (I hadn't done them on
2023-12-20 because of a skiped run meaning I hadn't warmed
up). However, I got back deep into a work investigation after
returning home, so I ended up skipping strength exercises.

On 2023-12-22, I deliberately skipped strength exercises due to a
[strained rib](2023-12-22-strained-rib.md). I also ran a little less
(a little over 1 mile instead of the usual 1.25 miles or higher),
though my total running + walking distance was as usual (2 miles).

## 2023-12-23: skipped jogging and strength exercises due to timing issues

On 2023-12-23, I made a trip during the day, which was about 2 hours,
and due to the timing of that trip and my need to eat after coming
back, I couldn't find a good exercise slot.

## 2023-12-24: halved run (running both ways) and skipped strength exercise due to timing issues

On 2023-12-24, it was cold and dark when I left for my run, and I also
needed to get back home soon for an appointment, so I did a halved
exercise where I only went out half the distance but I ran both
ways. For related reasons, I was not able to fit in strength
exercises.

There's now been an extended period without strength exercises, so I
should make sure to not miss the next couple of times.
