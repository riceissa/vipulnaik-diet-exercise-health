(see the Exercise plans section for plans and the Exercise section for
what actually happened)

For my right side wisdom tooth removal on Wednesday August 23, I took
a planned break from exercise. My stopping of all exercise started
Monday August 21, two days before the procedure, and continued till
Monday August 28.

On Tuesday August 29, I resumed some mild exercises
(standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed, hand gripper, flexibility
exercises, and Buteyko breath hold.

On Monday September 4, I went jogging for the first time since
stopping. I took a break on Tuesday September 5, and then starting
Wednesday September 6 I resumed my full normal routine including
jogging and strength exercises (weights and pushups).

## 2023-09-20 to 2023-09-23: break from exercise due to air quality issues

More details: [2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md](2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md)

Berkeley experienced air quality issues from the afternoon of
2023-09-19 to the evening of 2023-09-23. I had already finished my jog
on the morning of 2023-09-19 prior to the air quality issues. For
2023-09-20 to 2023-09-23, I skipped jogging, strength exercises, as
well as other exercises to keep my breathing needs to a minimum.
