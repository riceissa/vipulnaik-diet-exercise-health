# 2021-07-10: COVID ongoing precautions update

I [got my second Pfizer COVID dose on June
25](2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md), and therefore achieved
"fully vaccinated" status by the end of July 9. This allows me to
participate in most activities unmasked. I am now doing an updated
risk assessment to decide what activities to participate in and what
level of masking to use.

I used [microCOVID](https://www.microcovid.org/) to build intuition
but my ultimate scoring was not directly determined by the numbers
reported by microCOVID.

I expect to revisit these decisions around October 2021 once the dust
has settled further around the delta variant and its impact on
infection rates and transmission risk.

## Risk profiles

For simplicity, I classify riskiness of activities into four risk profiles:

* Negligible risk: The risk is so small that to a first approximation
  I ignore it.
* Mild risk: The risk is small enough that I look for trivially
  equivalent substitutes where available, but it's not a reason to
  choose to defer or cancel the activity.
* Moderate risk: The risk is big enough that I may consider deferring
  or cancelling the activity. The decision is ultimately based on its
  necessity and upside.
* High risk: The risk is big enough that only a high necessity or
  upside would justify it.

## Activities and risk profiles

### Table of guesses

Activity | Risk level without KN95 mask | Risk level with KN95 mask
-- | -- | --
Grocery store trip (moderate crowding) | Mild | Negligible
Convenience store trip (very little crowding) | Negligible | Negligible
Restaurant takeout (no extended waiting indoors) | Negligible | Negligible
Laundromat trip | Mild | Negligible
Restaurant dine-in alone during low crowding | Mild | N/A
Restaurant dine-in; not alone or during high crowding | Moderate | N/A
BART use (low crowding, enough to maintain distancing) | Mild (though masking is needed on BART anyway) | Negligible
BART use (high crowding, pre-COVID-style) | Moderate | Mild
Healthcare settings (blood tests, dentist trip) | High | Moderate
Extended outdoor or they're-masked indoor in-person interaction with 1-3 low-risk people | Mild | Negligible
Extended they're-unmasked indoor interaction with 1-3 low-risk people | Moderate | Mild
Outdoor in places like downtown Berkeley, the Mission, or downtown San Francisco | Negligible | Negligible

### Implications for mask-wearing

In cases where wearing a KN95 mask transitions the risk profile to a
lower one, I will wear it. This basically applies to everything other
than convenience store trips and restaurant takeout.

I will generally wear a KN95 mask for my laundromat trips. Hopefully
our building laundry machine will be fixed soon enough that I won't
need to make such trips.

I will generally wear a KN95 mask when in downtown Berkeley for
grocery shopping. I may, however, choose to take it off for the rest
of my downtown Berkeley trip, or may not. That would be more a
decision of convenience.

I will also wear masks on BART trips and in healthcare settings except
where not possible (e.g., dental examination and cleaning).

For trips to Walgreens or Target, or takeout from Bangkok Thai Cuisine
or Mehak Indian Cuisine, I may forgo mask-wearing entirely, or just
use a cloth mask.

### Implications for activity selection

I will not proactively try to dine in at restaurants, using takeout
where I am indifferent. If I do dine in, I'll try to select a time of
low crowding.

I will also generally try to avoid extended in-person interaction,
using phone/Zoom where feasible. When having in-person interaction,
I'll try to do it outdoors or with both sides masked.

For healthcare settings, I will generally avoid them except for
activities that have been pending for a long while (e.g., dentist
trip).
