# Slight anal bleeding starting 2023-06-19

On 2023-06-19, I noticed slight bleeding in my anal area after
vigorous wiping after passing a motion. The bleeding was slight and I
wasn't experiencing pain (maybe a bit of itching over the past few
days). I noticed a similar slight level of bleeding on 2023-06-20 so I
decided to make a note of it.

As of 2023-06-20, I am not planning to take any remedial action other
than continuing to monitor for and document bleeding.

This is significantly less painful and noticeable than the [2021-09-12
anal swelling incident](2021-09-12-anal-swelling.md).
