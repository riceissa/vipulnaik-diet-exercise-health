# 2023-01-22: finger cut

On the evening of Sunday January 22, while having dinner, while trying
to open a pack of Alvarado's Sprouted Wheat Tortillas, I accidentally
pressed my finger too hard against the sharp edge. I noticed a
reddening and slight pain on the front of my index finger of my right
hand (the fingerprint area). I did not pay much thought to it, but
then noticed at the end of my meal that there were bloodstains in the
area. They came off upon washing, and then there was another brief
fresh round of bleeding, but after the second round of washing, the
wound seems to have sealed.

The severity seems to be partly related to cold weather and partly
related to a weird angle of cutting.

I'm planning to bandage the cut overnight but keep it unbandaged until
then since a bandage would interfere with other activities during the
day and would come off when I wash my hands anyway.
