# 2022-07-01: bleeding cut on right middle finger PIP joint

On 2022-07-01, I noticed bleeding of a cut on the PIP joint of my right middle finger.

## Original cut: a few days old

I believe the original cut was at least three days old, as I had first
noticed it a few days ago. At the time, it was not bleeding. Whenever
I was using vaseline I would take special care to rub over the cut.

Unfortunately, the location of the cut was such that handwashing or
use of hand sanitizer risked touching the cut. It also meant that
bandaging the cut was somewhat inconvenient. So, although I did use
vaseline, I didn't bandage the cut prior to it starting to bleed.

I was initially worried there would be a bleeding incident similar to
the left middle knuckle bleed seen with the last [eye and skin
irritation](2022-05-26-eye-and-skin-irritation.md). I would be
particularly careful to check multiple times during my
jogging. However, by 2022-07-01, I felt that the cut was in the
process of healing as it hadn't bled yet.

### Potential root causes

One potential root cause is one of my shorts that had zipped pockets;
when putting stuff in or taking stuff out of the zipped pockets, that
portion of skin can come in contact with the zip lining.

While frequent handwashing may be an aggravating factor (partly
cancelled by the use of vaseline) I don't believe it was causal and
the rest of my hands seem to be in good shape.

I don't think the irritation is weather-related because it has been
warm and the rest of my skin is in good shape.

## Noticing bleeding

On the evening of 2022-07-01, after working on my computer in the dark
for about two hours (and maybe applying vaseline sometime in between
that), when I got up to get water, I put on the light, and I noticed
bleeding of the cut. I applied vaseline and bandaged the cut. I'm not
sure if bandaging will be feasible in the longer term, but I'm hoping
to at least bandage overnight and for the morning run.

## Retrospective

### Avoid the initial cut on the knuckles

Once there is an initial cut on the knuckles, it's pretty hard to
avoid it getting to eventually bleed -- extreme care is needed and
even then is not sufficient. The knuckle location has the downside of
frequent exposure through hand activity, handwashing, and hand
sanitization. Being extremely careful of what the knuckles come in
contact with (e.g., zipper linings) and moisturizing them regularly,
is key. Where possible, prefer to use the front of the hands than the
back.

### Once there is an initial cut, bandage it preemptively unless extremely inconvenient

Bandage the cut, even if the location is such that the bandage won't
last and will need to keep being changed. Remove the bandage
preemptively for the tasks where it's inconvenient, then re-bandage
the area. For instance, it may make sense to remove a hand bandage
while eating, brushing teeth, bathing, etc. Even with frequent
changes, though, the total cost of the bandages won't come to much if
the base frequency isn't that high. At each change assess the
situation with the cut. Generally, it should take about a week to heal
with bandages, and maybe two weeks without? (If the wound doesn't
bleed at all, and I remove the bandage carefully, I can even reuse the
bandage after taking it off for activities where it gets in the way).

I already have a lot of bandages and can stock up on more. Prevention
of the small cuts in the first place is ideal, but if we do get past
it, it's better to splurge on bandages.

### Reduce frequency and intensity of handwashing and hand sanitizer use, and try to avoid hitting the injured areas

I tried it this time but maybe not as much as I should have.

One related tip is for drying: I generally dry vigorously with a
towel. The towel works fine for healthy skin, but it might be too
harsh to rub vigorously against injured skin. So I need to be delicate
with the towel when using it against the injured skin.

### Don't stretch the finger area too much

Stretching the finger can place strain on the injury even if the
injured area doesn't come into direct contact with anything.

### Use vaseline on injured areas (ideally e.g., five minutes before applying a new bandage)

I did it this time, it didn't seem to have prevented eventual bleeding
but may have both delayed and reduced the magnitude.
