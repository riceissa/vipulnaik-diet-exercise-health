# 2023-09-22: upper right wisdom tooth gum area pain

Starting around 2023-09-22, I noticed some pain in the right area of
my teeth, felt when probing with my tongue, stretching my mouth wide
open, or during flossing.

Also relatedly, I had a small injury on my right cheek; I think this
is technically called a mouth ulcer; however, looking inside my mouth
I don't see anything as dramatic as the pictures of mouth ulcers
suggest.

I suspect that the root cause of the injury was accidental biting
while eating; I vaguely remember one such incident in the recent past
but do not remember exact details. I also expect that the pain in my
upper right area is either caused by the mouth ulcer or by the biting
incident that caused the mouth ulcer.

There has been no bleeding (even while brushing and flossing) and no
distraction-level pain; I only feel the pain when probing the area
deliberately.

I've been using the left side of my mouth more for chewing and biting,
mostly to let the right side heal more fully from the [wisdom tooth
removal](2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md), but did start
trying to use the right side a bit more in the past week, and the
injury was probably a result of that effort. Also it's likely that
that area of the mouth was still a little more sensitive and easier to
injure (that's the reason I was using it less in the first place).

I have an upcoming dental cleaning appointment on 2023-09-27, so if
this persists it'll get looked at as part of that appointment.
