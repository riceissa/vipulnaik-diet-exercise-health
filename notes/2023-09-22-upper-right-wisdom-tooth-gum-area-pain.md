# 2023-09-22: upper right wisdom tooth gum area pain

## Description

Starting around 2023-09-22, I noticed some pain in the right area of
my teeth, felt when probing with my tongue, stretching my mouth wide
open, or during flossing.

There has been no bleeding (even while brushing and flossing) and no
distraction-level pain; I only feel the pain when probing the area
deliberately.

## Self-diagnosis

Also relatedly, I had a small injury on my right cheek; I think this
is technically called a mouth ulcer; however, looking inside my mouth
I don't see anything as dramatic as the pictures of mouth ulcers
suggest.

I suspect that the root cause of the injury was accidental biting
while eating; I vaguely remember one such incident in the recent past
but do not remember exact details. I also expect that the pain in my
upper right area is either caused by the mouth ulcer or by the biting
incident that caused the mouth ulcer.

I've been using the left side of my mouth for most of my chewing and
biting; this is in order to let the right side heal more fully from
the [wisdom tooth
removal](2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md), but did start
trying to use the right side a bit more in the past week, and the
injury was probably a result of that effort. Also it's likely that
that area of the mouth was still a little more sensitive and easier to
injure (that's the reason I was using it less in the first place).

## Planned next steps

* I have an upcoming dental cleaning appointment on 2023-09-27, so if
  this persists it'll get looked at as part of that appointment.

* I'll make sure to try to reduce the use of the right side of my
  mouth, particularly for chewing hard things such as nuts, for the
  next few days, at least until the dental cleaning appointment. Based
  on diagnosis or improvements during the appointment, I might or
  might not extend further.

* Starting 2023-09-24, I'll use floss picks for both after-meal
  flossings for the next few days, rather than using interdental brush
  after one meal and floss picks after the other (this trades off a
  little more time and slightly more cost against somewhat better
  cleaning of the area). I plan to follow this practice till at least
  the dental cleaning appointment on 2023-09-22.
