# 2022-12-13: gum bleed

On 202-12-13, while brushing in the evening, I brushed my lower teeth
a little more vigorously than usual, and then when I took my
toothbrush out of my mouth I noticed that it had blood on it. I washed
my toothpaste with soap and spat out some more blood, then confirmed
that I wasn't actively bleeding. The area of bleeding appears to be
the lower right teeth, around the middle area.

With my tongue, I can feel that particular area to be raw, compared to
other areas.

This incident is reminiscent of the [2022-05-29 gum
bleed](2022-05-29-gum-bleed.md) in terms of its timing and potential
causes.

## Potential causes

### Build-up

It's been almost six months since my last dentist appointment and
about one week to my next appointment, so it's likely that there's
some buildup that's making such incidents more likely, but overall the
rest of my gums feel healthy.

### Some recent dietary accident

I've actually had less spicy food in the last week than usual, but
it's possible that some food disagreed with me.

### Physical accident e.g., due to flossing vigorously

It's possible that I injured the area during a recent flossing effort,
though the injury was probably minor as it didn't show up immediately.
