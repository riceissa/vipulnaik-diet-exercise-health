# Lipid-lowering strategies

Last substantive update: 2024-12-20

I expect to flesh these out more in the future; as of now, this is a
dumping ground of thoughts.

## For 2025 and early 2026: lifestyle + regular measurement + continue investigating pharma strategies

### Lifestyle

My goal is to continue to maintain and improve my lifestyle. I don't
have very concrete improvements in mind.

### Measurements

* Regular benchmarking: Take regular measurements of Apo B + basic
  lipid panel about once a quarter, and NMR lipoprofile (instead of
  basic lipid panel) once every 9 months. This will also help capture
  seasonal changes (as my food intake and energy cycle differ quite a
  bit based on temperature).

* More one-off blood tests: Add in other related things to measure,
  cycling between them so that by the end of 2025 I have at least one
  reading for each relevant measure. Examples: c-reactive protein,
  homocystein, Lp-PLA2.

  I don't plan to retest Lp(a) within 2025 or early 2026 because it
  does not change much over a short period and does not respond much
  to lifestyle and supplements.

* One-time benchmarking of current state of things that the lipids are
  affecting: coronary artery calcium (CAC) comes to mind right
  now. Maybe also get an echo and cardiac MRI to gauge risk of aortic
  valve stenosis, which my Lp(a) places me at risk for.

### Pharma investigations

* Statins: Cost, side-effects, specific risk factors for me, likely
  trajectory of these costs, estimate of how much they'll help at
  various doses.

* PCSK9 inhibitors (injections): Cost, process of doing the injection,
  pros and cons, likely trajectory of these costs, estimate of how
  much they'll help at various doses.

* PCSK9 inhibitors (oral): Monitor the trial for MK-0616. [Merck

  [study ending September
  2025](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05952869?id=NCT05952869&rank=1),
  [outcomes trial ending November
  2029](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06008756?term=mk0616&checkSpell=false&rank=3). The
  drug will likely become available only after the outcomes trial. If
  the drug is very effective, though, the trial may terminate early
  and the drug may get approved sooner.
