# 2024-04-25: abdominal pain

## Earlier in the week (Sunday 2024-04-21)

On 2024-04-21, I was out for an event and ate outside food that is
somewhat different than my usual food. The experience also involved
waking up early and standing for a long time. Overall, the experience
fatigued me and the food may not have agreed with me, though other
than slight soreness in my threat, I didn't really experience
significant immediate symptoms related to the food.

Due to waking up early on the morning of 2024-04-21 (around 5:45 AM), I
wasn't able to have a regular bowel movement that day, but I did have
a regular bowel movement the next day, and on the whole I felt that I
had recovered by the next day.

## Amazon package pickup (Tuesday 2024-04-23)

On 2024-04-23, I went for Amazon package pickup, which involved a
decent amount of walking with a heavy load. However, I did skip
jogging and strength exercises on this day, so I think on the whole my
exercise level was normal.

## Overnight sleep from Tuesday 2024-04-23 to Wednesday 2024-04-24

I also stayed up till pretty late, partly because of the additional
time with the Amazon package pickup trip, and partly because I spent
some time at night doing personal chores (password recall drill) after
a fragmented day, and I ended up going to sleep after 2 AM. However, I
didn't sleep in so I got up around 7:30 AM on Wednesday (2024-04-24)
morning, which means I had a bit of a sleep backlog.

Though I don't stay up this late very often, it's also not
super-unusual. In the past, though, I've slept in a bit later when
going to sleep late, and I didn't do so this time because I've formed
a habit of waking up early after my recent timezone adjustment from my
India trip. The net effect was that I had fewer hours of sleep than
usual going from Tuesday to Wednesday. In and of itself, I would not
consider this concerning, as I am usually able to catch up with slight
sleep backlogs the next day. I also had a normal bowel movement on the
morning of 2024-04-24, suggesting that the sleep had not caused any
immediately visible disruption to my digestive cycle.

## The day before (2024-04-24)

On 2024-04-24, I got takeout from Udupi Palace for my evening
meal. This was the same as my usual takeout, but the gap since the
previous time I had had the takeout was quite large (16 days) so my
body might have become unacclimated to it. But otherwise it was a
pretty normal takeout.

There were also some stressful events related to the house (that began
shortly prior to my Udupi Palace meal consumption). These were not
fully resolved by end of day but the plan was to resolve them the next
day. This plan succeeded.

I ended up going to sleep around 11:30 PM, which is a fairly typical
time to go to sleep. Without any sleep backlog, my natural waking-up
time would be somewhere between 7 AM and 8 AM. It's likely that with
my slight sleep backlog, my natural waking up time would have been
around 8:30 AM.

## The day of (2024-04-25)

### Before the pain (7:34 AM to 8:40 AM approximately)

On 2024-04-25, I was woken up around 7:34 AM by alerts. This is around
my natural waking-up time; however, in light of the fact that I had
underslept the previous night, I may have naturally slept in a little
longer.

After acking them, I went back to sleep and slept for about 10 minutes
more, till the approximate time that I would normally have woken up
(but, given my sleep backlog, I may actually have continued in bed for
a little longer). I got out of bed around 7:50 AM.

I went for a bowel movement around 8:40 AM, which is a little later
than usual (both in absolute terms and relative to my time of waking
up). Until then, I had not experienced any notable pain or discomfort.

### Onset of pain during bowel movement (8:40 AM to 9 AM approximately)

The pain started in my abdominal area (middle, neither left nor right)
during the process of the bowel movement some time shortly after 8:40
AM. The bowel movement was fairly incomplete but there was still some
movement.

In hindsight, one mistake I made at this stage was to strain myself to
try to do a bowel movement rather than just give up. This may have
been an aggravating factor for my pain.

### Return to computer and subsequent attempts to rest (9:10 AM to 9:50 AM approximately)

After finishing the partial bowel movement, I returned to my computer
and worked for a little while, but the pain was making it difficult
for me to concentrate. The seated posture also seemed painful.

At 9:30 AM, I lay down in bed, however, the lying down posture was
also difficult for me, so I sat up in bed, resting against the
wall. This posture didn't suit me either.

### Second attempted bowel movement (9:50 AM to 10:10 AM approximately)

Around 9:50 AM, I did my second attempted bowel movement. It wasn't so
much that I felt bowel pressure, but more that the posture of bowel
movement felt more attractive to me. I did have a little bit of bowel
movement, though it was even smaller than the previous one, and the
total across the two bowel movements was still a little less than a
normal morning bowel movement.

### Acetaminophen consumption (probably around 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM)

While I don't have clear records, I believe this was the time that I
took my acetaminophen tablet with water. While I didn't record the
time of consumption when I did it, I do have some search queries and
webpage visits that I believe were around the time of the consumption,
that my browsing history shows to have been made around this time.

### Trying to work from bed then alternating between bed and table (10:20 to 11:55 AM approimately)

As the seated posture wasn't working well for me, I moved my laptop to
my bed (something I do very rarely) in order to work from
bed. However, after about 10-15 minutes, my pain felt more acute, so I
stopped work, closed the laptop, moved it back to the table, and then
tried various postures including going back to bed, staying seated,
leaning forward.

At around 11 AM, I initiated various notification steps, marking
myself out of office for work and asking colleagues to take over my
on-calls.

At some point I was moaning and sighing pretty acutely, and it was
around this time that I decided I should make a trip to urgent
care. Around 11:42 AM, I called the nearest urgent care facility and
talked to them; they said they don't do appointments so I would have
to come and wait, with the waiting time starting only after my
arrival.

A few other notes:

* I experienced some chills, but no fever (my measured temperature was
  98.0 degrees Fahrenheit, though I don't consider the temperature
  measurement to be very reliable). I switched from shorts to pants
  and also switched to a thicker sweatshirt.

* I tried to measure my heart rate with the pulse oximeter, but it was
  failing to give a reading, and I gave up after a bit.

### Seeming improvement in symptoms and outside trip (11:55 AM onward)

Around 11:55 AM, I had a pretty rapid improvement in symptoms, with
the acute pain subsiding. My initial thought was that now, the
symptoms were good enough that I would be able to walk to the urgent
care (rather than take an Uber/Lyft).

I don't know if this improvement is due to the acetaminophen (as it
started around 100 minutes after, which is higher than the 45 minutes
that is generally expected for acetaminophen. The significance is that
if it's just acetaminophen masking the continued underlying issue,
then the issue would recur as the acetaminophen wore off; however, at
least for that day and the next day, acute pain did not return, so my
current suspicion is that the acetaminophen was not the primary
reason, though it might have helped.

One other thing that happened around the same time as my symptom
improvement was progress toward the resolution of my house
issues. This is suggestive that the stress associated with the house
issues was aggravating my pain, but it could just be a coincidence.

At around 12:05 PM, I left my home, heading toward the urgent
care. However, a few minutes in, I felt that I was feeling well enough
that going to urgent care didn't make sense. So I changed direction
and went to Berkeley Bowl to stock up on some food items that might
make sense given my digestive issues -- rice and vegan yogurt (I
already had some rice at home, but I had just used up my vegan yogurt
supply yesterday and had anyway been planning to go purchase more).

### Continued reasonable health

For the rest of the day (2024-04-25) I continued to be reasonably
functionally well. A lot of the morning and early afternoon was spent
in documentation work and wrapping up various threads, so my first
meal of the day was delayed to 4 PM, by which time my pain had cleared
enough for me to feel hungry.

I did have to do a large load of regular laundry, which ended up
resulting in me delaying dinner to about 9 PM, going to bed fairly
late (around 12:30 AM).

## The next day (2024-04-26)

On 2024-04-26, I woke up around 8:40 AM, so I got a decent eight hours
of sleep, like the previous day, but still not enough to catch up on
the minor backlog built on Tuesday. I went for a bowel movement around
10:20 AM, once there was enough pressure. I had a fairly small bowel
movement, but unlike the previous day (2024-04-25) I did not try to
push too hard. I did not experience much abdominal pain.

I had a lot of threads to wrap up, so I ended up having my meal around
1:15 PM.

Considering that I don't have any big deliverables with work and
personal projects, don't need to cook or do laundry, and don't plan to
go exercise, I expect to be able to sleep a little early and thereby
catch up on the sleep backlog.

In the evening, I experienced a resurgence of salivation and masseter
muscle pain, though it was way less than the peak that I had
experienced after my [2024-04-03 dental
cleaning](2024-04-03-dental-cleaning.md). I don't know if it was a
continuation or a different cause.

I went to sleep early, around 10 PM, with the hope that a
longer-than-usual sleep would help me with recovery.

## Two days later (2024-04-27)

I naturally woke up around 6:40 PM, feeling more refreshed, though
with continued salivation issues. However, unlike past cases of
salivation issues, I felt I had better control and wasn't drooling.

A little later, around 7:30 AM, I went for bowel movement. My bowel
movement was fairly normal qualitatively and only a little less than
usual in magnitude.

I had my morning meal around 11 AM. I tried a little bit of the lavash
and felt a little bit of irritation with that, so I decided that I
would cook another batch of rice for the evening as my current batch
of rice was ending (if I had reacted well to the lavash, I might have
switched back to lavash).

In the evening, I cooked rice and also ended up opening my second
almond milk yogurt pack to continue to soothe my stomach.

I went to sleep around midnight.

## Three days later (2024-04-28)

I naturally woke up around 6:50 AM. I went for a bowel movement at
around 7:10 AM and had a fairly normal bowel movement.

I cooked my potatoes prep in the morning and had my meal around 11
AM. I had my second meal around 5 PM. I felt fairly normal during the
day though still a little heavy in the abdominal area. I went to sleep
shortly before midnight. Around the time of going to sleep, I did feel
(in addition to being a bit heavy in the abdominal area) a little bit
of postural discomfort (not outside the range of what I occasionally
feel even when well) that I anticipated partly to staying up late. The
discomfort persisted a little bit when I lay down but soon subsided
and I had a decent sleep.

## Four days later (2024-04-29)

I got up around 6:35 AM to urinate, then went back to bed for an hour.

When I woke up, I continued to feel a little heavy in the abdominal
area, but otherwise was fine -- I had a normal bowel movement. After
the bowel movement, I felt largely fine, though still a little
sluggish.

Slight abdominal discomfort continued through the day, and it seemed
to be higher up than before (above the belly).

At around 3:50 PM I decided to initiate a teleconsultation. I
requested a teleconsultation via Teladoc (through my insurance). I
filled in my history and indicated that my problem was a type of
pain. I gave my phone number and was told I'll get a callback
shortly. I got a callback within a minute.

The doctor who called me asked me a bunch of questions that elicited
some portion of the details shared here. Based on my answers, he said
that I didn't fit in any particular condition based on the
information, but he recommended going to urgent care where they may do
a physical exam and run blood tests and a urine test. The urine test
would be on-site. I asked about kidney stones and he said that the
urine test would help with determining that.

I went to the Milvia Urgent Care facility of Sutter Health, arriving
there a little before 5:30 PM, but they had a long enough queue of
patients until their closing time, so I left with the intention of
returning on a later date.

I had dinner around 7:30 PM.

I went to sleep around 10:25 PM. This was both due to my desire to
sleep early in order to get enough sleep (as I suspected that my sleep
needs were a little higher than usual due to whatever healing my
system needed to do) and because I was in fact feeling sleepy.

### Five days later (2024-04-30)

I woke up around 6:40 AM and urinated, then went back to sleep. I
properly woke up a little before 7:30 AM.

I went for bowel movement at around 7:45 AM. I had a regular bowel
movement. I verified that I did not see any red or black marks (that
might indicate GI bleeding).

I continued to feel a little bit of abdominal discomfort, but it was a
little less than what I remember of yesterday, and it wasn't severe
enough to get in my way,

I also made a trip to urgent care; details of the trip itself are
recorded [here](2024-04-30-urgent-care-visit-and-tests.md).

## Potential causes and aggravating factors

### Some kind of continued effect of recent travel and travel-induced stress

This is a bit of a far-fetched theory that was suggested to me: we're
more susceptible to problems in the aftermath of travel. Indeed, the
increased salivation after the dental cleaning (see next section) may
also be an aftereffect of recent travel.

### Aftermath of dental cleaning

After my [2024-04-03 dental cleaning](2024-04-03-dental-cleaning.md),
I experienced an increase in salivation and masster muscle
tension. This had mostly subsided by around 2024-04-18. However, it's
possible that some of the same causes for it also triggered the
abdomiinal pain. The resurgence of salivation on 2024-04-26 evening,
the day after the abdominal pain, is suggestive of this.

### Food factors

#### One-off food factors

* The food on Sunday 2024-04-21 was from a new source, and the kind of
  food is not something I regularly partake of, though it's also not
  food I have never had. I did have a few symptoms (slight soreness of
  throat) in the day after having the food, but was otherwise fine. I
  had a normal bowel movement from Monday 2024-04-22 to Wednesday
  2024-04-24.

* The outside food on 2024-04-24 from Udupi Palace may not have agreed
  with me. This would be weird, though, since I've had this food
  several times without issues, so unless there was something
  specifically wrong this time, I don't see the problem.

Either of these, or just some other food that I regularly consume, may
have contributed either in terms of the food itself, or some sort of
contamination of the food. I do not have any other indications of
contamination though.

#### Dietary changes in recent weeks

I normally have Alvarado Sprouted Wheat Tortillas from Trader Joe's as
my main source of wheat; however, starting around 2024-04-08, Trader
Joe's ran out of stock for these so I started buying other
alternatives, including TJ Carb Savvy Tortillas, TJ Indian Style
Flatbread, and TJ Whole Wheat Lavash. I ultimately settled on TJ Whole
Wheat Lavash since the Carb Savvy Tortillas also ran out of stock, and
the flatbread was too heavy for me. Although the lavash was pretty
reasonable, it is not quite as good as the sprouted wheat.

While I didn't experience any clear negative reaction (other than
enjoying the taste less) before the abdominal pain, I did notice after
the abdominal pain that sampling a little bit of the lavash did make
me feel a bit irritated. I don't know if it is psychosomatic, but this
led me to stick to rice for a few more days.

### Sleep factors

* Going from Saturday 2024-04-20 to Sunday 2024-04-21, I had to wake
  up early (around 5:45 AM), so I went to sleep early as well (around
  10 PM). Although the number of hours in bed was about normal, it
  took me some time to fall asleep after going to bed around 10 PM, so
  effectively I had fewer hours of sleep, and indeed I was unable to
  have a bowel movement when I woke up on Sunday morning. However, my
  digestive cycle *seemed* to be back to normal on the morning of
  Monday 2024-04-22.

* I got only 5.5 hours of sleep (around 2 AM to 7:30 AM) from
  2024-04-23 to 2024-04-24 (the day before my weird symptoms) which
  created a slight sleep backlog. However, I did have a normal bowel
  movement on 2024-04-24, so there was no immediate impact on my
  digestive cycle, and I generally expect the digestive cycle impact
  to be immediate.

* From 2024-04-24 to 2024-04-25, I had about eight hours of sleep
  (11:30 PM to 7:34 AM) which would have been enough normally, but
  didn't include extra sleep to catch up on the backlog. Moreover, I
  was woken up by an alarm on the morning of 2024-04-25, rather than
  fully naturally. So I might not have had enough sleep.

### Stress factors

* **Very unusual**: From 2024-04-24 evening (when I had the Udupi
  Palace meal) to 2024-04-25 around noon (when the acute abdominal
  pain started subsiding) I was facing a stressful house
  situation. While my conscious mind wasn't continually stressed about
  it, the issue may have upset some of my autonomic nervous system.

* **Moderately unusual**: I don't think I was consciously stressed
  about the event of 2024-04-21, but it (both the event itself and the
  travel back and forth, as well as the impacts on sleep cycle and
  digestive cycle that I previously mentioned) was pretty unusual and
  it may have gotten my systems a little out of whack in ways that
  were hard to notice.

* **Moderately unusual**: There's also another slightly stressful
  thread related to my personal projects that has been going on for
  the past few days.

Overall, I would say that I don't think stress caused the issue, but
it may have aggravated some aspects of the situation. In particular,
it may have triggered some kind of autonomic responses overnight from
2024-04-24 to 2024-04-25 that caused me to have more acute abdominal
pain rather than just a smaller bowel movement.

The first of the stress factors is the only one I would deem *very*
unusual -- it's the kind of thing for which no comparable thing has
happened for at least a year and probably for several years (though
other *different* kinds of stressors have happened in the past few
years that I would consider of comparable magnitude). I don't have
enough of a track record to know how my digestive system reacts to
these kinds of events.

### Kidney stone

I might have or have had a kidney stone. A stone can explain
significant discomfort across different positions, and subsequent
easing once the stone changes position. It's worth noting that I did
not pass urine at the time my symptoms improved around 11:55 AM on
2024-04-25, so the symptom improvement was not tied to passing out of
a stone. I have also not seen any evidence of kidney stones in my
excreted urine so far (and I do weakly expect that I would see some
evidence of this similar to that described
[here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755).

The notable thing about kidney stones is that they generally develop
over a longer period of time, so that this super-recent events
analysis likely doesn't cover the factors that led to the kidney
stone. Among these longer-term factors, my diet is high in
oxalates. At least, that's my unofficial sense comparing my [food
purchases](../sql/food_purchases.sql). I don't think I drink too
little water though; my sense is that my water consumption is
reasonable and maybe a little bit on the higher side, though there may
have been some periods in between where my water consumption dropped.
