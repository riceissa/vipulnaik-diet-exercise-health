## Prior preparation and review on 2023-08-18

### Medical stuff

#### Painkillers

I believe I'm already stocked up on medical stuff. This includes stuff
from the left side appointment that I didn't complete:

* 4 left-over doses of hydrocodone / acetaminophen 325 mg each, out of
  10 total (I used up 6)
* 14 left-over doses of ibuprofen 800 mg each, out of 20 total (I used
  up 6)

In addition, I have over-the-counter acetaminophen and ibuprofen,
within expiration date, as follows:

* 23 doses of acetaminophen (I had one dose as a test previously out
  the 24 total) 500 mg
* 20 doses of ibuprofen 200 mg

This seems like more than enough in terms of painkillers, and so I can
request to not be prescribed any further painkillers.

#### Antibiotics

I have 22 doses left out of the 28 doses of clindamycin, that I
stopped due to adverse effects. This time, I would like to *not* take
antibiotics so as to not disturb my digestion again. However, I'll see
if the doctor has strong views on this, or has a suggestion for
alternative antibiotics.

#### Gauze and gauze pads

I expect to get gauze and gauze pads at the location, but I also have
a stock of gauze and gauze pads purchased from Walgreens, that I can
use if I need more after using up the ones at the location.

### Food

#### Food purchase trips

My current plans for food trips are as follows:

* DONE 2023-08-18: Trip to Trader Joe's Friday August 18 for regular
  food purchase -- during this trip, the only difference from my usual
  routine will be that I will *not* purchase tortillas, carrots, nuts,
  and sauerkraut.

* Trip to Berkeley Bowl some time between Saturday August 19 and
  Monday August 21: I'll use this trip to stock up on vegan yogurt,
  and possibly to purchase more rice.

* Possible additional trip to Trader Joe's between Saturday August 19
  and Monday August 21: I might do an additional trip for more focused
  stocking up, to minimize the need for further food trips in the week
  after the surgery.

My goal is to be fully stocked up on food by the end of day Monday
August 21 so that I do not need to take any trips on Tuesday August
22, and can focus on meal prep and relaxing at home.

#### Food consumption guidance prior to procedure

These are my current thoughts on foods to avoid:

* **No nuts consumption after Friday August 18**: As nuts are hard and can
  cause minor tooth injuries, I want to avoid them to reduce the risk
  of injuries to my right side (where it might compound the pain) and
  my left side (that I need in a very functional state as I can only
  use that side).

* **No outside food consumption after Friday August 18**: As outside food
  carries slightly more risk, I want to have Friday August 18 be the
  last day for outside food.

* **No sauerkraut consumption after Sunday August 20**: As sauerkraut is a
  bit acidic and can cause a sore throat, and I've had issues with it
  in the past, I will stop consuming sauerkraut after August 20.

These are my thoughts on foods to add in:

* **Vegan probiotic yogurts**: I will resume having vegan probiotic
  yogurts prior to the operation to replace sauerkraut for the
  probiotic benefits.

* **Tomato soup**: I should probably finish the existing batch of
  tomato soup prior to the operation (and throw it out if it's not
  great) so that after the operation I start on a fresh batch and
  reduce the risk of digestive upset.

These are my thoughts on timing:

* **Finish second meals by 8 PM every day starting Saturday August 19**: This
  is to keep my digestion in good shape.

  How did I do?

  * Saturday August 19: Finished around 7:30 PM

* **Go to sleep by 11:30 PM every day starting Saturday August 19**: This is to
  promote early sleep/waking and reduce the risk of digestive cycle
  issues on the day of the procedure.

  How did I do? See the sleep section.

* **Finish first meals by 11:30 AM every day starting Saturday August
    19**: This is again so that the day of the operation is not
    unusual in terms of the timing of my first meal.

  How did I do?

  * Saturday August 19: Ended shortly after noon (about 30-45 minutes
    late), because I slept late on Friday.

  * Sunday August 20: Ended shortly after noon (about 30-45 minutes
    late); that's because I woke up a bit late as I slept an
    additional hour to catch up on a slight backlog.

  But I expect Monday and Tuesday to be according to plan, as I don't
  even plan to do a morning jog so even if I wake up the same time as
  Sunday I'll be good (and probably I'll wake up earlier as I'll
  continue to sleep earlier).

#### Meal prep prior to procedure

* I should make sure I'm well-stocked on mixed vegetables prior to the
  procedure.

* I should also make sure I'm well-stocked on cooked potatoes so I can
  resume them as soon as I can have soft solid food.

* I should also make sure I'm well-stocked on cooked peas so I can
  resume them as soon as I can have soft solid food.

* Ideally I should cook rice on Tuesday so that I can have it cool
  (without spending prep time) when I am ready to resume.

I should budget a bunch of time on Tuesday for all the needed meal prep.

#### Food consumption guidance after procedure

Based on my experience with the left side wisdom tooth removal, I
expect to have food around 5.5 hours after the procedure, i.e., around
7 PM.

This is my current plan:

* Wednesday August 23 7 PM: Cool liquid foods (mix of vegan probiotic
  yogurts, almond milk, miso soup, and tomato soup)

* Maybe Wednesday August 23 late night (around 1 AM): Cool liquid foods again

* Maybe Thursday August 24 morning/early afternoon: Cool liquid foods again

* Thursday August 24 evening (after doing at least one saltwater rinse
  without any forceful spitting): Soft solid foods (rice, cooked
  potatoes, cooked peas, mixed vegetables) + cool liquid foods

* Continue with soft solid foods + cool liquid foods for at least
  three more days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). In particular, no
  tortillas or carrots.

* Starting Monday August 28 I can resume consumption of tortillas, and
  the next cooked meal can include carrots.

* As for outside food, no outside food until Saturday September 2.

#### When to go out for food purchases (to Trader Joe's, Berkeley Bowl etc.)

Unless I run out of stuff and need something urgently, I should aim to
stock up enough that I don't need to go out for food purchases until
Monday August 28.

#### When to start allowing food chewing on the right side

My current thinking is to start allowing food chewing on the right
side on Friday August 30, a week after the operation, assuming that
I've had at least a day without any significant pain.

### Sleep

As mentioned above, I aim to sleep by 11:30 PM every day starting Saturday August 19.

I also hope to wake up organically around 8:30 AM with natural bowel
movement within 30-45 minutes of waking up. I will set an alarm for
around 9:15 AM except on days where I have earlier appointments.

How did I do?

* Saturday August 19: I went to sleep around 11:35 PM, just five
  minutes later than the target.

### Exercise

#### Break from all exercise on Monday August 21, Tuesday August 22, and Wednesday August 23

I want to be well-rested prior to the operation, so I'll take a break
from all exercise on Monday August 21, Tuesday August 22, and
Wednesday August 23 prior to the operation. This includes jogging,
weights/pushups, Buteyko breathing, and hand gripper exercises. I
might use the freed-up time on Monday to fit in a Trader Joe's trip.

I might make an exception for balance exercises (standing on one leg).

#### Extremely reduced physical activity for 26 hours after procedure

For the 26 hours after the procedure, except the return journey back
home, I should maintain extremely reduced physical activity. This
means no unnecessary walking/strolling, and mostly just sitting,
getting up for toilet trips, and going to sleep.

#### Continued break from all exercise until Monday August 28 (inclusive)

I should continue to take a break from all exercise until Monday
August 28 (inclusive).
operation, only if 

#### Resume balance exercises on Tuesday August 29

Starting Tuesday August 29 I can resume balance exercises.

#### Resume hand gripper exercises on Thursday August 31

Starting Thursday August 31 I can resume hand gripper exercises. I
should take care to not have the exercise result in a clenched jaw in
a way that could hurt my teeth.

#### Resume alternate-day jogging on Saturday September 2 and daily jogging on Monday September 4

My first jogging attempt can be on Saturday September 2. However, I
should rest the next day and start daily jogging on Monday September
4.

#### Resume weights and pushups around Wednesday September 6

I should resume weights and pushups around Wednesday September 6.

### Dental self-care

My current plan is as follows:

* **Saltwater rinses**: First saltwater rinse (no forceful spitting)
  around 26-30 hours after the operation. After that, regular
  saltwater rinses after each meal. Proactive rinse/spitting to only
  start at least 3 days after the operation.

* **Flossing**: Regular flossing excluding the sensitive area starting
  after the meal I have on the evening after the operation (so about
  30 hours after). Flossing near the sensitive area to begin about a
  week after the operation.

* **Brushing**: First brushing the night after the operation, so about
  36 hours after. Brushing of the sensitive area to begin a week after
  the operation.

### Laundry

I ideally want to be well-set in terms of laundry so that I don't have
to do laundry in the immediate aftermath of the operation. My plan is
to do regular and heavy laundry on Monday August 21. Last time I made
the mistake of having both laundry *and* food prep piled up for the
Tuesday right before the operation, so that that was a rather hectic
day (though still one where I stayed at home).

### Ice packs

I plan to apply the ice pack regularly on the affected area after the
operation, for about 5-6 hours.

### Self-measurement

I plan to take regular readings of temperature and heart rate
throughout the process.

## Measurements

### Measurement on 2023-08-22 around 2 PM (about 24 hours before the operation)

My temperature on the middle and right side was fine; it came in the
98 to 99 range. My temperature on the left side, however, came to 99.4
across multiple measurements.

On the pulse oximeter, my heart rate was within the 55-62 bpm range
most of the time, with occasional upward fluctuation to 65 and
occasional downward fluctuation to 51. My SpO2 was 97% most of the
time with the occasional downward fluctuation to 96%.

### Measurement on 2023-08-23 around 7:50 AM (morning of the operation)

This was after my bowel movement but before eating or doing any other
significant work for the day.

My temperature was around 98 degrees Faherenheit; different readings
of different parts of the forehead ranged from 97.4 to 98.9, but most
were between 97.7 and 98.2.

On the pulse oximeter, my heart rate was in the range of 44 to 49 bpm,
and my SpO2 showed as 99%. This is consistent with my previous
observations of lower heart rate and higher SpO2 in the morning.

### Measurement on 2023-08-23 around 2:15 PM (shortly after return home and gauze change)

My temperature readings were in the 98-99.5 degrees Fahrenheit range,
with a lot of variation that could be driven by measurement errors or
bodily fluctuations due to the ambient heat.

On the pulse oximeter, my SpO2 was around 97% (as expected). My heart
rate initially showed up in the 57-65 bpm range, but then went up to
the 65-72 bpm range in a few minutes, then started coming down. All in
all, only mildly higher than usual.

## Appointment

### Arrival at office

I arrived at the office shortly after 12:30 PM and finished the forms
stuff a little after 12:40 PM.

### Pre-operation discussion with doctor

Before the operation, I discussed with Dr. James Connors my previous
experience with the antibiotic. He said that the antibiotic is
optional, and that it's up to me whether to pick up the prescriptions
from the pharmacy, but he'll prescribe them anyway so that I have the
option of getting them from the pharmacy. As long as I don't pick them
up, I won't have to pay for them, and the pharmacy will eventually put
the pills back in their place so they won't go to waste.

He also felt that the pharmacy had made a mistake regarding not giving
me chlorhexidine.

### Confusion regarding laughing gas

There was some confusion regarding the administration of laughing
gas. The written note that the doctor had didn't say that laughing gas
was part of the procedure. I asked the doctor to double-check and to
administer the laughing gas to me. He ended up administering it and
later when I checked at the front desk they said that the laughing gas
was already paid for. It was good that I double-checked otherwise I
would have missed out on it.

### Procedure

The procedure began with the administration of a gel, after which the
local anesthetic was injected into the right side of my teeth. With
the laughing gas inhaler placed on my nose, I then had my wisdom teeth
extracted. The assisting doctor was a different one this time (female,
African-American). The procedure felt pretty similar to last time.

For my lower wisdom tooth, a mouth prop was used to get my mouth wide
open. However, the mouth prop wasn't wide enough for how wide I needed
to open my mouth for the wupper wisdom tooth. So I was asked to open
the mouth wider for that.

As with last time, I felt a lot of pressure/force but very little by
way of pain in the area, suggesting that the local anesthetic was
doing its job.

After the operation, the assisting doctor put a gauze pad in the area
and gave me a post-operative care package similar to last time's.

All the steps happened approximately between 1:20 PM and 1:40 PM.

### Return home

Unlike last time, I had no followup appointment to book, and also
nothing to pick up from the pharmacy, so I headed straight back home.

## Bleeding and gauze changes

### First gauze change after getting back home

After I got back home, changed clothes, unpacked stuff, etc. I did my
first gauze change around 2:10 PM.

* I unpacked the new gauzes and put them on the table for ready
  access.

* I removed the gauze pad that the doctor had put. It was soaked with
  blood.

* I then drooled out the accumulated blood and saliva. Based on
  learnings from last time, I was careful not to spit it out but just
  let it drool out. Also, since I was able to get back home earlier, I
  didn't have a lot of drool so it was not as messy as last time.

* I had a few sips of water, taking care to sip using my left side so
  that the glass didn't get the blood/saliva mix on my right side.

* Then I applied the new gauze pad and closed my mouth.

## Application of ice pack

My first application of the ice pack was from 2:15 PM to 2:30 PM,
after my return home from the operation and my first gauze change.

I then put it back in the freezer, then took it out again at 2:40 PM
for another round of application. I put it back in the freezer around
2:50 PM.
