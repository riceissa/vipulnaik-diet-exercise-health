# 2023-08-23 wisdom tooth removal (right side)

This document is about the right side wisdom tooth removal, part of
the [2023 wisdom tooth removal
saga](2023-wisdom-tooth-removal.md). For the left side, done prior,

## Prior preparation and review on 2023-08-18

### Medical stuff

#### Painkillers

I believe I'm already stocked up on medical stuff. This includes stuff
from the left side appointment that I didn't complete:

* 4 left-over doses of hydrocodone / acetaminophen 325 mg each, out of
  10 total (I used up 6)
* 14 left-over doses of ibuprofen 800 mg each, out of 20 total (I used
  up 6)

In addition, I have over-the-counter acetaminophen and ibuprofen,
within expiration date, as follows:

* 23 doses of acetaminophen (I had one dose as a test previously out
  the 24 total) 500 mg
* 20 doses of ibuprofen 200 mg

This seems like more than enough in terms of painkillers, and so I can
request to not be prescribed any further painkillers.

#### Antibiotics

I have 22 doses left out of the 28 doses of clindamycin, that I
stopped due to adverse effects. This time, I would like to *not* take
antibiotics so as to not disturb my digestion again. However, I'll see
if the doctor has strong views on this, or has a suggestion for
alternative antibiotics.

#### Gauze and gauze pads

I expect to get gauze and gauze pads at the location, but I also have
a stock of gauze and gauze pads purchased from Walgreens, that I can
use if I need more after using up the ones at the location.

### Food

#### Food purchase trips

My current plans for food trips are as follows:

* DONE 2023-08-18: Trip to Trader Joe's Friday August 18 for regular
  food purchase -- during this trip, the only difference from my usual
  routine will be that I will *not* purchase tortillas, carrots, nuts,
  and sauerkraut.

* Trip to Berkeley Bowl some time between Saturday August 19 and
  Monday August 21: I'll use this trip to stock up on vegan yogurt,
  and possibly to purchase more rice.

* Possible additional trip to Trader Joe's between Saturday August 19
  and Monday August 21: I might do an additional trip for more focused
  stocking up, to minimize the need for further food trips in the week
  after the surgery.

My goal is to be fully stocked up on food by the end of day Monday
August 21 so that I do not need to take any trips on Tuesday August
22, and can focus on meal prep and relaxing at home.

#### Food consumption guidance prior to procedure

These are my current thoughts on foods to avoid:

* **No nuts consumption after Friday August 18**: As nuts are hard and can
  cause minor tooth injuries, I want to avoid them to reduce the risk
  of injuries to my right side (where it might compound the pain) and
  my left side (that I need in a very functional state as I can only
  use that side).

* **No outside food consumption after Friday August 18**: As outside food
  carries slightly more risk, I want to have Friday August 18 be the
  last day for outside food.

* **No sauerkraut consumption after Sunday August 20**: As sauerkraut is a
  bit acidic and can cause a sore throat, and I've had issues with it
  in the past, I will stop consuming sauerkraut after August 20.

These are my thoughts on foods to add in:

* **Vegan probiotic yogurts**: I will resume having vegan probiotic
  yogurts prior to the operation to replace sauerkraut for the
  probiotic benefits.

* **Tomato soup**: I should probably finish the existing batch of
  tomato soup prior to the operation (and throw it out if it's not
  great) so that after the operation I start on a fresh batch and
  reduce the risk of digestive upset.

These are my thoughts on timing:

* **Finish second meals by 8 PM every day starting Saturday August 19**: This
  is to keep my digestion in good shape.

  How did I do?

  * Saturday August 19: Finished around 7:30 PM

* **Go to sleep by 11:30 PM every day starting Saturday August 19**: This is to
  promote early sleep/waking and reduce the risk of digestive cycle
  issues on the day of the procedure.

  How did I do? See the sleep section.

* **Finish first meals by 11:30 AM every day starting Saturday August
    19**: This is again so that the day of the operation is not
    unusual in terms of the timing of my first meal.

  How did I do?

  * Saturday August 19: Ended shortly after noon (about 30-45 minutes
    late), because I slept late on Friday.

  * Sunday August 20: Ended shortly after noon (about 30-45 minutes
    late); that's because I woke up a bit late as I slept an
    additional hour to catch up on a slight backlog.

  But I expect Monday and Tuesday to be according to plan, as I don't
  even plan to do a morning jog so even if I wake up the same time as
  Sunday I'll be good (and probably I'll wake up earlier as I'll
  continue to sleep earlier).

#### Meal prep prior to procedure

* I should make sure I'm well-stocked on mixed vegetables prior to the
  procedure.

* I should also make sure I'm well-stocked on cooked potatoes so I can
  resume them as soon as I can have soft solid food.

* I should also make sure I'm well-stocked on cooked peas so I can
  resume them as soon as I can have soft solid food.

* Ideally I should cook rice on Tuesday so that I can have it cool
  (without spending prep time) when I am ready to resume.

I should budget a bunch of time on Tuesday for all the needed meal prep.

#### Food consumption guidance after procedure

Based on my experience with the left side wisdom tooth removal, I
expect to have food around 5.5 hours after the procedure, i.e., around
7 PM.

This is my current plan:

* Wednesday August 23 7 PM: Cool liquid foods (mix of vegan probiotic
  yogurts, almond milk, miso soup, and tomato soup)

* Maybe Wednesday August 23 late night (around 1 AM): Cool liquid foods again

* Maybe Thursday August 24 morning/early afternoon: Cool liquid foods again

* Thursday August 24 evening (after doing at least one saltwater rinse
  without any forceful spitting): Soft solid foods (rice, cooked
  potatoes, cooked peas, mixed vegetables) + cool liquid foods

* Continue with soft solid foods + cool liquid foods for at least
  three more days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). In particular, no
  tortillas or carrots.

* Starting Monday August 28 I can resume consumption of tortillas, and
  the next cooked meal can include carrots.

* As for outside food, no outside food until Saturday September 2.

#### When to go out for food purchases (to Trader Joe's, Berkeley Bowl etc.)

Unless I run out of stuff and need something urgently, I should aim to
stock up enough that I don't need to go out for food purchases until
Monday August 28.

#### When to start allowing food chewing on the right side

My current thinking is to start allowing food chewing on the right
side on Friday August 30, a week after the operation, assuming that
I've had at least a day without any significant pain.

### Sleep

As mentioned above, I aim to sleep by 11:30 PM every day starting Saturday August 19.

I also hope to wake up organically around 8:30 AM with natural bowel
movement within 30-45 minutes of waking up. I will set an alarm for
around 9:15 AM except on days where I have earlier appointments.

How did I do?

* Saturday August 19: I went to sleep around 11:35 PM, just five
  minutes later than the target.

### Exercise

#### Break from all exercise on Monday August 21, Tuesday August 22, and Wednesday August 23

I want to be well-rested prior to the operation, so I'll take a break
from all exercise on Monday August 21, Tuesday August 22, and
Wednesday August 23 prior to the operation. This includes jogging,
weights/pushups, Buteyko breathing, and hand gripper exercises. I
might use the freed-up time on Monday to fit in a Trader Joe's trip.

I might make an exception for balance exercises (standing on one leg).

#### Extremely reduced physical activity for 26 hours after procedure

For the 26 hours after the procedure, except the return journey back
home, I should maintain extremely reduced physical activity. This
means no unnecessary walking/strolling, and mostly just sitting,
getting up for toilet trips, and going to sleep.

#### Continued break from all exercise until Monday August 28 (inclusive)

I should continue to take a break from all exercise until Monday
August 28 (inclusive).
operation, only if 

#### Resume balance exercises on Tuesday August 29

Starting Tuesday August 29 I can resume balance exercises.

#### Resume hand gripper exercises on Thursday August 31

Starting Thursday August 31 I can resume hand gripper exercises. I
should take care to not have the exercise result in a clenched jaw in
a way that could hurt my teeth.

#### Resume alternate-day jogging on Saturday September 2 and daily jogging on Monday September 4

My first jogging attempt can be on Saturday September 2. However, I
should rest the next day and start daily jogging on Monday September
4.

#### Resume weights and pushups around Wednesday September 6

I should resume weights and pushups around Wednesday September 6.

### Dental self-care

My current plan is as follows:

* **Saltwater rinses**: First saltwater rinse (no forceful spitting)
  around 26-30 hours after the operation. After that, regular
  saltwater rinses after each meal. Proactive rinse/spitting to only
  start at least 3 days after the operation.

* **Flossing**: Regular flossing excluding the sensitive area starting
  after the meal I have on the evening after the operation (so about
  30 hours after). Flossing near the sensitive area to begin about a
  week after the operation.

* **Brushing**: First brushing the night after the operation, so about
  36 hours after. Brushing of the sensitive area to begin a week after
  the operation.

### Laundry

I ideally want to be well-set in terms of laundry so that I don't have
to do laundry in the immediate aftermath of the operation. My plan is
to do regular and heavy laundry on Monday August 21. Last time I made
the mistake of having both laundry *and* food prep piled up for the
Tuesday right before the operation, so that that was a rather hectic
day (though still one where I stayed at home).

### Ice packs

I plan to apply the ice pack regularly on the affected area after the
operation, for about 5-6 hours.

### Self-measurement

I plan to take regular readings of temperature and heart rate
throughout the process.

## Measurements taken prior to appointment

### Measurement on 2023-08-22 around 2 PM

My temperature on the middle and right side was fine; it came in the
98 to 99 range. My temperature on the left side, however, came to 99.4
across multiple measurements.

On the pulse oximeter, my heart rate was within the 55-62 bpm range
most of the time, with occasional upward fluctuation to 65 and
occasional downward fluctuation to 51. My SpO2 was 97% most of the
time with the occasional downward fluctuation to 96%.
