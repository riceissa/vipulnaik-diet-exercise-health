# Sore throat after meals

On Saturday August 28, I noticed that for the past few days, I
experienced a slight sore throat for a period ranging from 30 minutes
to 2 hours after each meal (usually a little after brushing as
well). This was stronger on August 28 than previous days; still not
disturbing, but concerning enough to document.

I do not have a fever or any other symptoms of viral infection.

## Likely causes

I identified a few causes and expect to continue monitoring:

* **Consumption of red chillies**: Recently, I had consumed a red
    chillie (red hot pepper) whole in a spinach masala dosa I got from
    Udupi Palace. The next few times, I hadn't consumed it whole but
    had kept pieces of it and extracted juice. My practice
    historically had been to just throw out the chillies and not
    extract juice. I suspect that the spiciness of this was working against me.

* **Ongoing dental issues**: My gum disease (that I expect to [get
    periodontal therapy for in
    September](2021-08-11-dental-cleaning-trip.md)) hasn't caused me
    much direct pain, but I suspect it has made my sore throat more
    likely. The recent dental cleaning and increased flossing
    frequency may have actually worsened the problem in the short term
    by changing things around in my mouth, but I expect it to improve
    things long-term.

* **Increased frequency of veg biryani consumption (very recent)**: In
    the last few weeks, I reduced my consumption of veg biryani and
    misal curry. i recently increased my veg biryani consumption
    frequency (and stopped having misal curry) with the goal of
    clearing a backlog of stock. I don't think this had a big effect,
    but might have aggravated soem issues.

* **Aftereffects of bird's nest clearing**: While not the entire
    cause, [the bird's nest clearing, that had caused itchy
    skin](2021-08-22-fever-and-rash.md), might have also aggravated
    sore throat somewhat. In particular, it may have increased my
    sensitivity to other causes.

In the past, sore throat tendencies have cured themselves with slight
refraining from biryani, misal curry, and sauerkraut.

## Treatment

I gargled and sipped warm water with salt and turmeric. I also
consumed the two remaining pills of turmeric curcumin that I had.

I plan to continue to use warm water with salt and turmeric if I get
strong symptoms, but for the most part I expect to avoid chillies,
minimize consumption of biryani, and defer getting spinach masala dosa
for a few days.
