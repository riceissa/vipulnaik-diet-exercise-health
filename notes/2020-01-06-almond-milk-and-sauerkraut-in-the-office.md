# Almond milk and sauerkraut in the office

I've had a problem where, since I don't eat lunch in the office, I
have a huge time gap between meals during days I go to the
office. Starting Monday, January 6, 2020, I decided to remedy this by
having almond milk from Trader Joe's and [sauerkraut from Trader
Joe's](https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/4955) in the
office.

I usually get through one bottle of sauerkraut and one bottle of
almond milk over four days.

Observations after one week:

* I have stopped feeling slight hunger during the day that I used to
* I like the combination
* I do worry about starting to have cravings for sauerkraut and also
  about its acidic nature (which may or may not have been the cause of
  weird but not-too-painful sensations in my stomach), so I am
  planning to take rest days from sauerrkraut during the weekend and
  possibly one weekday.
