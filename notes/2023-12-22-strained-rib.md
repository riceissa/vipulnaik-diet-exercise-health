# 2023-12-22: strained rib

Early in the morning, before waking up, I noticed that an area of my
right rib was hurting and strained, likely as a result of bad posture
or movement while I was sleeping. In the early hours of the morning, I
slept mostly on my left side as it was painful to sleep on my right
side.

The pain was much less after I woke up and moved to a sitting
position, and I forgot about it for most of the day. However, I did
occasionally feel some pain when making sudden movements and when
carrying laundry up the steps.

Later, when jogging, I noticed a bit more fatigue than usual due to
occasional movement that strained the rib further. So, I jogged a
little less than I normally would (about 1 mile instead of 1.25 miles)
but my total jogging + walking distance was the usual 2 miles. I also
skipped the strength exercises that I would normally do after
returning from jogging, out of concern that the strength exercises
would add to the strain.
