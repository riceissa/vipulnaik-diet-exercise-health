# 2022-05-29: gum bleed

On 2022-05-29, while brushing in the evening and spitting out, I
noticed a small amount of blood in my spit. This was from a somewhat
inflamed area of the back upper left-to-middle gum area. Further
rinsing and spitting did not reveal more blood. My guess is that it
was a gum injury that was self-healing but the act of vigorous brushng
around the area reopened the wound a little bit.

Occasional gum bleeding isn't concerning in and of itself, but I'm
making a note here so I can see if it recurs.

The background inflammation/injury appears to have been around since
morning, though it hasn't been salient for me.

## Potential causes

### Build-up

It's been almost six months since my last dentist appointment and
about two weeks to my next appointment, so it's likely that there's
some buildup that's making such incidents more likely, but overall the
rest of my gums feel healthy.

### Some recent dietary accident

I've actually had less spicy food in the last week than usual, but
it's possible that some food disagreed with me.

### Physical accident e.g., due to flossing vigorously

It's possible that I injured the area during a recent flossing effort,
though the injury was probably minor as it didn't show up immediately.

### Side-effect of my generally greater irritation

It could be a side-effect of the constellation of factors related to
my recent [eye and skin
irritation](2022-05-26-eye-and-skin-irritation.md).
