# 2022-05-29: gum bleed

On 2022-05-29, while brushing in the evening and spitting out, I
noticed a small amount of blood in my spit. This was from a somewhat
inflamed area of the back upper left-to-middle gum area. Further
rinsing and spitting did not reveal more blood. My guess is that it
was a gum injury that was self-healing but the act of vigorous brushng
around the area reopened the wound a little bit.

Occasional gum bleeding isn't concerning in and of itself, but I'm
making a note here so I can see if it recurs. It's been almost six
months since my last dentist appointment and about two weeks to my
next appointment, so it's likely that there's some buildup that's
making such incidents more likely, but overall the rest of my gums
feel healthy.
