# 2023-08-04: sauerkraut, red chutney, and sore throat

## 2023-08-04

### Initial symptoms

On the morning of 2023-08-04, I woke up with a slight sore throat. I
believe the cause is that the previous day (2023-08-03) I had consumed
both a decent amount of the red chutney that comes with spinach masala
dosa (left over from a previous trip since I don't consume it along
with the spinach masala dosa itself but on a separate day) and also
sauerkraut. Unlike my normal practice of limiting my sauerkraut
consumption to only one meal a day, I had on 2023-08-03 consumed
sauerkraut in both meals and consumed red chutney with one meal.

My recovery plan is to refrain from sauerkraut and red chutney for at
least three days, and at least two days *after* my sore throat seems
gone. [EDIT: After some further thought I've decided to refrain from
both of these until at least the time of the right side wisdom tooth
removal, currently scheduled 2023-08-16, even if I am fully cured by
then, so as to prevent a recurrence.]

NOTE: This incident has some similarities to a [similar incident in
2021](2021-02-27-sauerkraut-and-sore-throat.md). Unlike that past
incident, the total amount of aggravating stuff was less this time,
and so I also expect the recovery to be faster. I think one reason to
experience this despite the lower amount of aggravating stuff could be
that I am still experiencing some of the vestigial aftereffects of the
antibiotic-induced digestive issues after the wisdom tooth removal.

### Actions during the day

I went for a jog as usual in the morning.

In the evening, when I went to Trader Joe's, I did *not* make my usual
companion trip to Udupi Palace for spinach masala dosa
purchase. That's because I expect that the sambhar and other
ingredients there might be aggravating.

However, the items I purchased at Trader Joe's were not adjusted for
sore throat. In particular, I got my usual items including
tomatoes. That's because I was forecasting that the sore throat would
be fixed in a couple of days.

### Actions during the day

Since my sore throat was still about as bad as the previous day, I
decided to take further actions. However, perhaps unwisely, I still
chose to go jogging in the morning.

Since I was cutting out sauerkraut while still not fully built back in
terms of probiotics, I made a trip to Berkeley Bowl (after my jogging
trip) to stock up on priobitic vegan yogurts. I also got some
additional rice. I expect this trip might save me a trip next week
ahead of the wisdom tooth removal operation.

I then did potatoes prep and rice prep. I held off on regular mixed
vegetables prep for a while since the full range of mixed vegetables
might not be a good fit for me (in particular, tomatoes might be a bad
idea given the sore throat, so I want to wait a couple of days to see
the recovery trajectory before deciding whether or not to include
tomatoes).

Unfortunately, I had a number of personal chores to finish, that kept
me up and about. Some of these were directly caused or influenced by
not feeling well, including the Berkeley Bowl trip, the potatoes prep,
and the rice prep. Some were necessary tasks that just so happened to
be scheduled for that day, including regular laundry. And then there
was house cleaning, that I had started the previous day and wanted to
continue for various administrative reasons.

By the evening, I also had a somewhat runny nose along with the sore
throat, so I started using tissues much more heavily than usual. I
also noticed that i urinated quite frequently in the evening, with
frequent urination starting around the same time as the runny nose. It
looks like my body was trying to get rid of something.

Throughout the day my temperature stayed normal, at around 98 degrees
Fahrenheit.

### Actions at night

At night, I kept the trash can near my bed so that I could blow my
nose if needed at night and throw the tissues in the trash can.

I had a relatively good sleep. I did get up once at night, blew my
nose, and urinated. But then I went back to a sound sleep.

### Possibility of a cold rather than irritants?

While my leading possibility is still that the food irritation is what
caused the sore throat and subsequent runny nose, there is a
posibility that this is a common cold. I don't think that's the case,
because I have not met anybody in the four days prior to the start of
symptoms, even before that my contact was minimal, and the symptoms
started with a sore throat and only later went on to runny
nose. However, I can't rule out the possibility that this is a
cold. Either way, I expect to be fully recovered in about a week.

### Actions during the day

I woke up around 9:40 AM, after being semi-awake in bed for about 20
minutes. I decided not to go out jogging today, as I seemed to still
have a runny nose. Fortunately I don't have much by way of personal
chores today so I'm planning to mostly be sedentary today.
