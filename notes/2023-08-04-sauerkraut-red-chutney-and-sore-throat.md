# 2023-08-04: sauerkraut, red chutney, and sore throat

On the morning of 2023-08-04, I woke up with a slight sore throat. I
believe the cause is that the previous day (2023-08-03) I had consumed
both a decent amount of the red chutney that comes with spinach masala
dosa (left over from a previous trip since I don't consume it along
with the spinach masala dosa itself but on a separate day) and also
sauerkraut. Unlike my normal practice of limiting my sauerkraut
consumption to only one meal a day, I had on 2023-08-03 consumed
sauerkraut in both meals and consumed red chutney with one meal.

My recovery plan is to refrain from sauerkraut and red chutney for at
least three days, and at least two days *after* my sore throat seems
gone.
