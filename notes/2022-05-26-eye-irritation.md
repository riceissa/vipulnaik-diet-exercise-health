# 2022-05-26: eye irritation

## 2022-05-26

On 2022-05-26, I began experiencing a mild eye irritation. I believe
it started with, and was caused by, my opening a box of laundry
detergent powder. Although there was no incident involving a lot of
powder entering my eye, I have the impression that it was letting off
quite a bit of scent into the air.

I didn't notice the irritation immediately on exposure to the likely
irritant, but a little later. I washed my eyes. I also noticed a brown
spot in my right eye. The irritation was also stronger in my right
eye.

The irritation subsided by the next morning but came back
intermittently, once after breakfast and once after my evening run. In
both cases, I washed my eyes, though in the breakfast case I wasn't
able to wash my eyes immediately due to alternate commitments.

The irritation matched some but not all the symptoms of allergic
conjunctivitis. Most likely it's a minor eye irritation that should
resolve on its own in a few days.

Since I've had a little less sleep than usual in the last few days
(for a variety of reasons) I am hoping to get a longer night's sleep
and reassess next steps.

I investigated potential remedies, including eye drops, but will defer
purchases to a later date after seeing how things evolve.

By this time, there was no clearly identifiable or distracting eye
irritation, though when I self-probed there were times when I felt a
little irritation in the eye.

I also had occasion to do laundry again on this day, and I followed
various precautions to reduce potential for eye irritation:

* I used sunglasses while handling the laundry detergent.
* I kept the laundry detergent open for as little as possible; most of
  the time it was shut and enclosed in a plastic container.
