# 2024-04: tooth grinding investigation

In the [dental appointment on
2024-04-03](2024-04-03-dental-cleaning.md), the doctor suggested tooth
grinding as a likely cause of my generalized recession. She suggested
it might be happening more at night and recommended looking into a
night guard.

In order to be better informed on this, I decided to monitor my mouth
over the next few days (and nights) and take notes so that I could
figure out if I'm grinding and also what tweaks might get me to grind
less, if so.

## Default resting position

The default resting position of my mouth seems to be as desired; see
for instance
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/should-your-top-bottom-teeth-touch-when-mouth-closed-dr-smitha-pramod/)
and
[here](https://wilkinsonorthodontics.com.au/how-should-teeth-rest/). Specifically:

* My upper teeth are a little bit above and ahead of my lower teeth,
  so that there's a freeway space gap, as mentioned in the article.

* My upper teeth don't quite touch my lower inner area of the lip
  (i.e., there's a clear oral vestibule). Similarly, my lower teeth
  don't touch anything.

* My tongue is resting against my upper gums, as described
  [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/tongue-posture#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYour%20tongue%20should%20be%20touching,higher%20than%20your%20front%20teeth.%E2%80%9D).

So the problem, if any, isn't with my default resting position, but
rather with occasional, brief deviations from it.

## Types of deviation and reasons for deviation

My mouth doesn't deviate from its default resting position to a
different resting position; the deviations all involve brief
motions. There are two kinds of deviations I've noticed:

* The teeth bump into each other, generally front-to-back rather than
  up-to-down. To some extent, this is likely unavoidable, but the
  frequency can be reduced quite a bit.

* The teeth bump as above and then I slide the upper teeth against the
  lower teeth (left-to-right or right-to-left). I've observed this
  happen only at night, when I am asleep. I think this should be
  completely avoidable after some deliberate effort. I also think that
  this is substantially more dangerous per occurrence than the teeth
  just bumping into each other.

So far, through introspection, I've identified the following triggers
that increase the chances of the teeth bumping into each other:

* Mouth activity such as salivation, swallowing saliva, burping, etc.:
  As things move around in the mouth, the teeth move slightly to
  accommodate. If the movement is large enough, the teeth may bump
  into each other.

  The amount of such activity is higher when my mouth is dry, so
  drinking water is a good way to reduce the extent of such activity.

* Jerky physical movement or tension: For instance, an unexpected
  elevation when jogging, stopping suddenly, tensed muscles when doing
  hand grippers etc.

* Cold weather leading to shivering where my teeth are chattering
