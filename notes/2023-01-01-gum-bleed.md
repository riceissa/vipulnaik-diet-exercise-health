# 2023-01-01 gum bleed

On 2023-01-01, I had a slight bleeding in the gum above my upper
middle right teeth. The bleeding was only visible as a slight
reddening of my spit after brushing.

I believe this is due to the hot sambhar I had the previous day
(2022-12-31) as part of an in-person meal at Udupi Palace, as recorded
at [../sql/food_purchases.sql](food_purchases.sql).
