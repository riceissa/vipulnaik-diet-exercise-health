# 2021-09-29 periodontal therapy first appointment

This is an attempt to describe, from recollection, the events of the
first periodontal therapy appointment on 2021-09-29. This was intended
to be the date of the second periodontal therapy appointment, but the
first appointment date got canceled. My dental hygienist was Diane.

My appointment was for 1 PM but the hygienist was ready a little
earlier so we got started around 12:50 PM. We finished around 1:43 PM.

## Initial X-rays

Since I did not have any X-rays on file, the hygienist first took my
X-rays for the right side of the mouth, which was the side where she
planned to clean today. The X-rays took about 5 to 10 minutes.

## Local anesthetic

The hygienist applied a local anesthetic. My memory of the name
was "nobivac" but Googling that it sounds like a canine vaccine and
not a dental anesthetic. So I don't know the name, but I did gather a
few facts:

* The anesthetic can take between 1 to 5 hours to wear off -- varies a
  lot by person. The duration is long enough for finishing the
  procedure (that takes less than an hour). It should be on the order
  of hours not days.

* There's no big damage from swallowing a little bit of anesthetic.

* It's better to defer eating till the anesthetic has fully worn
  off. Eating while it's still on can result in drooling and is a bit
  risky.

In total, she applied anesthetic for my right half (with a little
extra margin covering a few more teeth) as well as the tip of my
tongue.

## Cleaning process

### Polishing

I'm actually unsure if this was before or after the local anesthetic,
but it was before the main scaling process. The hygienist did a little
bit of polishing.

### Scaling and root planing

The main work then began. For the most part, the anesthetic seemed to
work well. The only time I felt nontrivial pain was when the hygienist
went to the middle area oof my mouth where she touched on some areas
where anesthetic had not yet been applied. I communicated this to her
and she put a little anesthetic in that area as well.

### Scraping

Near the end, the hygienist did some scraping.

### Flossing

At the end, the hygienist flossed the teeth in the right half of the
mouth.

## Feedback and aftercare guidance

### Feedback

* The hygienist said my teeth were in great condition, and the problem
  was with the gums. She identified this as being because I didn't
  have sugar.

* The hygienist noticed some staining, and wasn't sure of the cause
  because I don't drink tea or coffee. The staining could be from past
  consumption of hot chocolate, or other liquid foods in diet.

### Recommendations

* The hygienist recommended switching to an electric toothbrush and
  suggested Philips Sonicare, as that would clean a bit better. This
  seemed like a general recommendation not tied to the specifics of my
  teeth.

* Part of the kit provided after treatment was a mouthwash fromm
  [Dr. H and Co](https://www.drhandco.com/). Though the bottle says to
  rinse thrice for 2 minutes each, she recommended rinsing at least
  twice for 1 minute each. She also suggested using saltwater if the
  mouthwash was too unpleasant.

## Next appointment

My next appointment was booked for next Wednesday, October 6, at 1 PM.
