## 2024-01-06: skipped run as it was rather cold

On Saturday 2024-01-06, after the high probability of rain stopped and
I was considering going out for my run, I saw that the outdoor
temperature was a little low, and it was also dark, so I decided to
skip my run on this day, and instead conserve my energy for other
things.

## 2024-01-09: trouble with standing-on-one-leg on right leg, and halved run running both ways

On 2024-01-09, I had trouble with the standing-on-one-leg exercise on
my right leg, failing to clear beyond 12 seconds across several tries,
and also shifting my right leg a lot. I didn't get a chance to do the
exercise again after jogging. The left leg was fine; I cleared 14
seconds on the first try.

I also did a halved run, running both ways, in order to get back in
time for a meeting.

## 2024-01-10 to 2024-01-13: skipped exercise for various reasons

On 2024-01-10, I had a long general catchup meeting with work
colleagues, and after that had to catch up on other things, and it was
also drizzling intermittedntly, and by the time I was done and the
drizzling stopped, it was dark. So I skipped jogging and other
exericses.

On 2024-01-11, the day was very hectic with a mix of day job work and
food prep, and I ended up not getting a chance to go jogging.

On 2024-01-12, I had to get my COVID vaccine in the afternoon, and so
I decided to skip exercise both for time reasons and to conserve my
energy.

On 2024-01-13, I skipped exercise as I was recovering from the COVID
vaccine and also because it was raising.
