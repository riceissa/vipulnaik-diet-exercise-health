## 2024-01-06: skipped run as it was rather cold

On Saturday 2024-01-06, after the high probability of rain stopped and
I was considering going out for my run, I saw that the outdoor
temperature was a little low, and it was also dark, so I decided to
skip my run on this day, and instead conserve my energy for other
things.
