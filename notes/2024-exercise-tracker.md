## 2024-01-06: skipped run as it was rather cold

On Saturday 2024-01-06, after the high probability of rain stopped and
I was considering going out for my run, I saw that the outdoor
temperature was a little low, and it was also dark, so I decided to
skip my run on this day, and instead conserve my energy for other
things.

## 2024-01-09: trouble with standing-on-one-leg on right leg, and halved run running both ways

On 2024-01-09, I had trouble with the standing-on-one-leg exercise on
my right leg, failing to clear beyond 12 seconds across several tries,
and also shifting my right leg a lot. I didn't get a chance to do the
exercise again after jogging. The left leg was fine; I cleared 14
seconds on the first try.

I also did a halved run, running both ways, in order to get back in
time for a meeting.

## 2024-01-10 to 2024-01-14: skipped most exercise for various reasons

On 2024-01-10, I had a long general catchup meeting with work
colleagues, and after that had to catch up on other things, and it was
also drizzling intermittedntly, and by the time I was done and the
drizzling stopped, it was dark. So I skipped jogging and other
exericses.

On 2024-01-11, the day was very hectic with a mix of day job work and
food prep, and I ended up not getting a chance to go jogging.

On 2024-01-12, I had to get my COVID vaccine in the afternoon, and so
I decided to skip exercise both for time reasons and to conserve my
energy.

On 2024-01-13, I skipped exercise as I was recovering from the COVID
vaccine and also because it was raising.

On 2024-01-14, I skipped most exercise again; although I had recovered
more, I needed to go for food purchases and then prepare food and I
wasn't able to slot my jogging in. However, I did do the
standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise and did a little bit of
hand gripper exercise.

## 2024-01-15: shorter run due to less energy

On 2024-01-15, instead of doing my usual 1.25 miles jogging + 0.75
miles walking, I did about 0.8 miles jogging + 0.8 miles walking. The
shorter distance was due to me feeling less energetic, which might be
a reflection of my continuing recovery from the COVID vaccine, or a
result of taking a break from jogging for a few days (I suspect the
former). While I could have pushed myself to jog a bit more, I felt
it's probably better to not push myself, so that I have more energy
left over for recovery and for the other things I plan to do today.

## 2024-01-16: skipped run due to intermittent rain

On 2024-01-16, it was raining intermittently throughout the afternoon
and evening, so I skipped my run.

## 2024-01-17: skipped strength exercises, slightly shorter running portion

On 2024-01-17, my energy levels had still not recovered fully to what
they used to be prior to the COVID vaccine. Instead of my usual
pattern of at least 1.25 miles running and the remainder of the total
2 miles spent walking, I only ran for 1 out of the 2 miles. This was
still an improvement over 2024-01-15, when I had done 0.8 miles
running + 0.8 miles walking.

I also skipped strength exercises, partly due to fatigue from running
and partly as a continued precautionary measure after the COVID
vaccine.

## 2024-01-18: continued to skip strength exercises, slightly shorter running portion (though longer than before)

On 2024-01-18, my energy levels had still not recovered fully to what
they used to be prior to the COVID vaccine. Instead of my usual
pattern of at least 1.25 miles running and the remainder of the total
2 miles spent walking, I only ran for 1 out of the 2 miles. This was
still an improvement over 2024-01-17, when I had done 1 mile
running + 1 mile walking.

## 2024-01-19 and 2024-01-20: skipped most exercises due to rain

On both these days, due to rain for large parts of the day, I skipped
jogging. Since jogging serves as a warmup for strength exercises, I
also skipped strength exercises. With that said, I did do the
standing-on-one-leg exercise on 2024-01-20 and hand gripper exercises
(probably) on both days.

## 2024-01-21: back to normal

On 2024-01-21, I did jogging (to my usual extent) and also resumed
strength exercises; this was my first time doing strength exercises
since the COVID vaccine that I had gotten on 2024-01-12. This was also
my first time doing strength exercises with two 8 lb dumb bells (I had
previously only been using one dumb bell so I had only been doing one
hand at a time). For more on the weight increase, see
[2024-01-21-weight-lifting-weight-increase.md](2024-01-21-weight-lifting-weight-increase.md).

## 2024-01-22: skipped jogging due to rain

On 2024-01-22, I skipped jogging due to rain.

## 2024-01-24: skipped jogging due to rain

On 2024-01-24, I skipped jogging due to rain.

## 2024-01-27: skipped all exercise due to unusual day

See [2024-01-27: unplanned 22-hour
fast](2024-01-27-unplanned-22-hour-fast.md) for details of the day.

## 2024-01-30: accidentally skipped standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises

I skipped standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises before
heading out for my run; I noticed this as I was heading out, but
thought I'll do the exercises after I come back. However, after coming
back, I got busy responding to some work-related stuff and didn't get
a chance to do the exercises. Things were hectic with day job and
personal chores after that and the exercise slipped my mind. (I also
skipped strength exercises that I was supposed to do that day, but
this skipping doesn't yet reach the three-day threshold needed to
report in this document).

## 2024-01-31 to 2024-02-02: skipped most exercise due to rain and wet sidewalks

From 2024-01-31 to 2024-02-02, I skipped most exercise due to a
combination of curent rain and wet sidewalks due to recent rain. While
the rain was intermittent, and with sufficient monitoring I could have
snuck a run in, it was difficult to plan around that while also
getting other work done.

## 2024-02-04 and 2024-02-05: skipped exercise due to rain

On 2024-02-04 and 2024-02-05, I skipped exercise due to rain.

## 2024-02-06: continued to skip strength exercises

I got a break from strength exercises on 2024-02-04 and 2024-02-05 as
I didn't go jogging on those days. On 2024-02-06, I was able to jog
again, so now I could do strength exercises. However, a bunch of stuff
came up and I wasn't able to get to the strength exercises in time.

## 2024-02-07: skipped exercise due to rain and wet sidewalks

On 2024-02-07, I skipped exercise as it was raining till the afternoon
and the sidewalks were stil wet in the evening.

## 2024-02-08: continued to skip strength exercises

On 2024-02-08, I was able to jog again, so now I could do strength
exercises. However, a bunch of stuff came up and I wasn't able to get
to the strength exercises in time.

## 2024-02-11: slightly shorter running portion

On 2024-02-11, I jogged only 1.1 miles and walked back the remaining
0.9 miles, rather than the usual split that involves at least 1.25
miles of jogging.

## 2024-02-14: skipped exercise due to rain

On 2024-02-14, I skipped exercise due to rain. I did, however, do hand
gripper exercises.

## 2024-02-15 to 2024-02-20: skipped most exercise due to travel and related pre- and post- adjustment and other bureaucratic stuff

I was traveling from 2024-02-16 evening (in Pacific Standard Time) to
2024-02-18 morning (in Indian Standard TIme). I didn't go out to
exercise on 2024-02-15 and 2024-02-16 so that I could focus on travel
preparation, and also to adhere to reduced risk mode (e.g., to reduce
the risk of injuries when running). After arrival, I was busy for the
first few days unpacking, making various updates to adjust to the new
environment, and taking care of some bureaucratic stuff. I also wanted
to stay in reduced risk mode until these were done, so I skipped
exercise on these days.

I did do some standing-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercise, a little
bit of hand gripper exercise, and a couple of breath holds over this
period.

## 2024-02-21: jogging resumed (in India)

On 2024-02-21, I resumed jogging in India. I think the running
distance and walking distance are fairly similar to those that I use
in Berkeley. The path is somewhat different: rather than public
sidewalks, it's an internal walkway within the apartment complex. One
way this matters meaningfully is that there are no intersections where
I need to cross vehicular traffic, so that my movement is effectively
uninterrupted. In contrast, in Berkeley, I might have to pause for
anywhere from a few seconds to a minute in light of vehiclular traffic
conditions.

## 2024-02-26: strength exercises resumed (in India)

On 2024-02-26, I resumed strength exercises in India, including
weights and pushups.

## 2024-02-29: skipped jogging (in India)

I skipped jogging on this day to conserve time and energy for a
bureaucratic trip in the morning.

## 2024-03-02 to 2024-03-05: skipping most exercise

I'm skipping most exercise over this time period in order to focus on
some bureaucratic stuff (and then on recovery from it).

## 2024-03-14 to 2024-03-23: skipping most exercise

I'm skipping most exercise over this time period. My travel dates were
2024-03-15 to 2024-03-16. I skipped exercise on 2024-03-14 to conserve
energy for travel prep. I am skipping exercise on 2024-03-17 and
2024-03-18 to preserve energy for recovery from travel and for the
trips I need to make for setting things back up after my return.

The period of 2024-03-19 to 2024-03-21, and 2024-03-22 morning, was
busy with other chores, including outside trips, so that I couldn't
get around to doing exercise.

On 2024-03-22 afternoon/evening and 2024-03-23 it was raining or had a
high probability of rain.

## 2024-03-24: resumption of jogging

On 2024-03-24, I resumed jogging. I was feeling a little lower on
energy, but still did the usual running/walking mix, with the running
part being a little slower than usual but not shorter.

## 2024-03-27: skipped jogging due to shopping and WeWork trip

On 2024-03-27, I went to Trader Joe's for shopping in the morning, and
made a trip to WeWork in the afternoon. As a result, I couldn't go
jogging.

## 2024-03-28: skipped jogging to preserve time and energy for package pickup and shopping

On 2024-03-28, I spent a bunch of time and enery on package pickup
from the Amazon locker and then a little more time shopping at
Walgreens. As a result, I didn't have time to go jogging.

## 2024-03-29: skipped jogging due to rain

On 2024-03-29, I skipped jogging due to rain and wet sidewalks through
the day.

## 2024-03-30: resumption of weight exercises and jogging

On 2024-03-30, I resumed weight exercises. The last date of weight
exercises was 2024-03-13. I also resumed jogging; the last date of
jogging was 2024-03-26.

## 2024-04-02 onward: weights skipped

On 2024-04-02, weights were due (as I had last done them on
2024-03-30); however, I skipped them as I had some chores to finish. I
had similarly skipped on 2024-04-01 for chores.

I also skipped on 2024-04-03 as I was out for dental cleaning, and
then on 2024-04-04 as I didn't go jogging due to rain.

## 2024-04-03 and 2024-04-04: skipped jogging

On 2024-04-03, I skipped jogging so that I could go for my dental
cleaning.

On 2024-04-04, I skipped jogging due to rain, wet sidewalks, and cold
weather.

## 2024-04-11: skipped jogging due to lack of time and energy after another trip

On 2024-04-11, I went out for shopping in the evening and by the time
I got back, I was too fatigued to go jogging. This was partly related
to the time and partly due to it being hotter than usual.

## 2024-04-13: skipped jogging due to weather

On 2024-04-13, it was raining off and on through the day, so I skipped
jogging.

## 2024-04-14: slightly-more-than-halved jog, jogging both ways

On 2024-04-14, there was a nontrivial probability of rain, so instead
of jogging the full distance, I jogged a little over halfway and then
jogged back. My total jogged distance was the same as usual, but I had
a shorter walk back.

## 2024-04-17: skipped strength exercises

I had previously done strength exercises on 2024-04-14, so I needed to
do them on either 2024-04-16 or 2024-04-17. Neither day worked well,
due to a combination of fatigue (partly due to it being hotter than
expected), and partly due to issues of scheduling.

## 2024-04-18: skipped jogging and strength exercises

On this day I skipped jogging and strength exercises, mainly because
work related to my day job ended up extending till fairly late in the
day and I also needed to do some cooking work, so squeezing in
exericse would be tight on my time and my energy levels.
