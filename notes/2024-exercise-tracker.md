## 2024-01-06: skipped run as it was rather cold

On Saturday 2024-01-06, after the high probability of rain stopped and
I was considering going out for my run, I saw that the outdoor
temperature was a little low, and it was also dark, so I decided to
skip my run on this day, and instead conserve my energy for other
things.

## 2024-01-09: trouble with standing-on-one-leg on right leg, and halved run running both ways

On 2024-01-09, I had trouble with the standing-on-one-leg exercise on
my right leg, failing to clear beyond 12 seconds across several tries,
and also shifting my right leg a lot. I didn't get a chance to do the
exercise again after jogging. The left leg was fine; I cleared 14
seconds on the first try.

I also did a halved run, running both ways, in order to get back in
time for a meeting.
