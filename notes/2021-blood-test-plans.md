Current list of planned tests. I'll target doing them around July 2021
assuming COVID vaccine rollout is a success:

* https://requestatest.com/vitamin-d-25-hydroxy-testing ($75)
* https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing ($59)
* https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing ($39)
* https://requestatest.com/lipid-panel-testing ($39)
* https://requestatest.com/cbc-with-differential-testing ($34)

Total: $246, nontrivial but affordable.

I generally have a reasonably stable diet, and I'm not doing any of
the vitamin supplements right now that would affect insulin testing.

I decided against these:

* https://requestatest.com/vitamin-b12-testing ($59): I was at upper
  end of range last time and I have been taking supplements regularly,
  so I doubt there will be a problem.
* https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-testing
  and https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-quantitative-testing
  because they don't seem necessary yet.
