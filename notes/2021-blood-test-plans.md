Current list of planned tests. I'll target doing them around July 2021
assuming COVID vaccine rollout is a success:

Total: LabCorp: $409, Quest Diagnostics: $373, nontrivial but affordable.

Past test results at https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/sql/test_results.sql (some of these are referenced without details below, so linking to the SQL file for those interested in checking details).

## Vitamin D: test the success of supplementation in the last 3 years

Test details: https://requestatest.com/vitamin-d-25-hydroxy-testing (LabCorp: $75, Quest Diagnostics: $59)

I have been using regular Vitamin D supplementation since November
2017 and saw an improvement from deficient to low-end-of-normal range
between November 2017 and September 2018. I expect to now be in the
mid-to-high range given that I increased my supplement dose. If I get
in that range, I may continue supplementing at current levels and skip
Vitamin D testing for the next few years.

## Insulin: First baseline test because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing (LabCorp: $59; Quest Diagnostics: $49)

I haven't gotten an insulin test done so far (at least, as far as my
records show). Since I have family members with diabetes, getting
baseline insulin readings may be helpful.

I generally have a reasonably stable diet, and I'm not doing any of
the vitamin supplements right now that would affect insulin testing.

## HbA1c: Followup measurement because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $36)

My last HbA1c test, in December 2016, came back normal (reading of
5.5). However, since I have family members with diabetes, getting
another reading (almost 5 years after the previous reading) makes
sense.

## Lipid panel: Followup measurement because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/lipid-panel-testing (LabCorp: $39; Quest Diagnostics: $36)

My last lipid panel in 2017 came back normal. However, given that I
have made a few dietary changes since then, and given diabetes in my
family members, I want to get another test almost four years after the
previous one.

## Complete blood count: one-time baseline

Test details: https://requestatest.com/cbc-with-differential-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $35)

This is hopefully a one-time baseline. I'm not looking for anything
specific but it would be good to get information related to white
blood cells and immunity.

## Omega-3

Test details: https://requestatest.com/omega-3-blood-test (LabCorp: $129; Quest Diagnostics: $129)

I [started omega-3
supplementation](2019-12-30-decision-to-start-taking-omega-3-supplements.md)
in early 2020. I want to get a baseline measurement after one year of
supplementation.

## Calcium: test the success of both calcium and vitamin D supplementation in recent years

Test details: https://requestatest.com/calcium-testing (LabCorp: $34; Quest Diagnostics: $29)

I have been taking both calcium and vitamin D for a while, so I want
to test my blood calcium levels to make sure that the end result for
my calcium is good.

## Tests that didn't make the cut

I considered and ultimately decided against these:

* https://requestatest.com/vitamin-b12-testing ($59): I was at upper
  end of range last time and I have been taking supplements regularly,
  so I doubt there will be a problem.
* https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-testing
  and https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-quantitative-testing
  because they don't seem necessary yet, and because I got a normal
  result for the latter in 2016.
* Various creatine/creatinine tests: I am still thinking about
  these. This is an area where I am likely to be deficient (per my
  2016 test results) but I also don't currently expect to take
  significant action even if I were deficient.
* Magnesium
* Zinc
* Vitamin K
