Current list of planned tests. I'll target doing them around July 2021
assuming COVID vaccine rollout is a success:

Total: $246, nontrivial but affordable.

## Vitamin D: test the success of supplementation in the last 3 years

Test details: https://requestatest.com/vitamin-d-25-hydroxy-testing ($75)

I have been using regular Vitamin D supplementation since November
2017 and saw an improvement from deficient to low-end-of-normal range
between November 2017 and September 2018. I expect to now be in the
mid-to-high range given that I increased my supplement dose. If I get
in that range, I may continue supplementing at current levels and skip
Vitamin D testing for the next few years.

## Insulin: First baseline test because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/insulin-testing ($59)

I haven't gotten an insulin test done so far (at least, as far as my
records show). Since I have family members with diabetes, getting
baseline insulin readings may be helpful.

I generally have a reasonably stable diet, and I'm not doing any of
the vitamin supplements right now that would affect insulin testing.

## HbA1c: Followup measurement because of diabetic tendencis

Test details: https://requestatest.com/hemoglobin-a1c-with-eag-testing ($39)

My last HbA1c test, in December 2016, came back normal (reading of
5.5). However, since I have family members with diabetes, getting
another reading (almost 5 years after the previous reading) makes
sense.

## Lipid panel: Followup measurement because of diabetic tendencies

Test details: https://requestatest.com/lipid-panel-testing ($39)

My last lipid panel in 2017 came back normal. However, given that I
have made a few dietary changes since then, and given diabetes in my
family members, I want to get another test almost four years after the
previous one.

## Complete blood count: one-time baseline

Test details: https://requestatest.com/cbc-with-differential-testing ($34)

This is hopefully a one-time baseline. I'm not looking for anything
specific but it would be good to get information related to white
blood cells and immunity.

## Tests that didn't make the cut

I decided against these:

* https://requestatest.com/vitamin-b12-testing ($59): I was at upper
  end of range last time and I have been taking supplements regularly,
  so I doubt there will be a problem.
* https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-high-sensitivity-testing
  and https://requestatest.com/c-reactive-protein-quantitative-testing
  because they don't seem necessary yet, and because I got a normal
  result for the latter in 2016.
