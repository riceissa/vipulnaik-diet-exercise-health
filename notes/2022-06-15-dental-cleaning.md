# 2022-06-15 dental cleaning

This was a regular dental cleaning appointment. It was the successor
to the [2021-12-15 periodontal therapy followup
appointment](2021-12-15-periodontal-therapy-followup-appointment).

The hygienist, Lingho, was the same as last time.

## Mouthwash

I was initially asked to use mouthwash.

## Evaluation

The dentist did a quick examination of my teeth and confirmed to the
hygienist that my teeth are good, but to watch out for "tooth 14".

## Cleaning process

### Scraping/scaling

The hygienist began with quick plaque scraping without the air blower
for a few areas.

She then went on to do a systematic scraping with the air blower on.

### Polishing

The hygienist ended with using a prophylactic cup for polishing my
teeth.

### Flossing

The hygienist ended with flossing my teeth.

## Comments by dental staff

### Dental care recommendations

The hygienist suggested flossing in addition to using an interdental
brush, particularly for hard-to-reach back teeth (she said the
interdental brush isn't small enough to get into all the
crevices). She also said I should get the wisdom tooth removed some
time, though things are ok for now.

For flossing, she recommended using a floss pick and attaching it to a
floss holder (that's similar to a toothbrush) so that it's easier to
reach far back.

## Followup appointment

The next appointment has been booked for Wednesday, December 21, 2022
at 1 PM.
