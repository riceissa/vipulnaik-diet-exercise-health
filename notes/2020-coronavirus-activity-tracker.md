# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This will be useful in case either I come down with coronavirus, or
somebody in my vicinity does and my activity needs to be tracked.

I exclude trips for jogging and running during which I did not come in
proximity to anybody.

## Monday March 23

* Around 12:30 to 1:30: I went to Walgreens and purchased toilet paper
  and paper towels (two rolls each). The cashier there was the regular
  person and I can recognize his picture. I paid by card.

* Around 5:30 to 7: I went to Trader Joe's and purchased a number of
  groceries. I had to wait in line to enter the store, maintaining six
  feet distance. After purchasing, I went to withdraw cash from the
  Citibank ATM.

## Wednesday March 25

* Around 1 PM: I went to Bangkok Thai Cuisine and ordered yellow curry
  tofu to go. I paid by cash. The server was one of the regular
  people and I can recognize her.

* Around 1:57 PM: I went to Bangkok Thai Cuisine and ordered yellow
  curry tofu to go. I waited in the restaurant (server wasn't near me
  while I waited) and got the food arond 2:05 PM. The server was the
  same one whom I saw on Wednesday March 25. There were also other
  patrons who picked up orders but I did not get close to them. The
  walk to the restarant is around five minutes each way, so I was
  outside the home from arouund 1:50 PM to 2:10 PM.

  was a young black female whom I haven't seen before. I arrived and
  started waiting in line at 5:50 PM, got into the store around 6:10
  PM, and left the store around 6:15 PM. I was outside the home from
  around 5:30 PM to around 6:35 PM. While waiting in line, the person
  in front of me was a young male wearing a black jacket; the person
  behind me was an old man with a mustache and an umbrella.

## Tuesday March 31

* Around 6:55 to 7:10 PM: I was at Bangkok Thai Cuisine getting yellow
  curry tofu. A waiter took my order and a waitress gave it to me at
  the door. Both wore masks and I recognize them. There were some
  other customers.
