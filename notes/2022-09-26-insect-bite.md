# 2022-09-26 insect bite

While returning from my run, at around 9:45 AM, I was bitten by an
insect in my lower right leg. The insect was small and yellow; it
might have been a thrip according to quick Googling.

Luckily I was almost home by then. It stung a bit for a few minutes
and then stopped stinging, but there was a bit of swelling. I applied
vaseline to the wound.
