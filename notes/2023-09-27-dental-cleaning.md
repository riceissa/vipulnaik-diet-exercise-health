# 2023-09-27 dental cleaning

This is a regular dental cleaning appointment at Total Health Dental
Care at 3017 Telegraph Avenue, scheduled for 2023-09-27 at 1 PM. The
previous dental cleaning appointment was on
[2022-12-21](2022-12-21-dental-cleaning.md); however, in the interim I
had my wisdom teeth removed ([overall
details](2023-wisdom-tooth-removal.md), [left
side](2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md), and [right
side](2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md)).

## Prior preparation and review on 2023-09-24

### Documentation of recent gum pain and possible minor mouth ulcer

I documented an incident of recent gum pain and possible minor mouth
ulcer [here](2023-09-22-upper-right-wisdom-tooth-gum-area-pain.md). I
did this prior to writing this planning doc, because I expect that
there's some overlap in the considerations arising from both docs.

### Experience based on past appointments

Historically for me, regular dental cleanings have not required any
post-operative care, since they do only a surface-level
cleaning. Occasionally, there's a bit of temporary pain; however, the
pain stops once the relevant cleaning has been done. There has been no
need for dietary restrictions in the immediate aftermath of the
appointment. Overall, my experience has been that my teeth feel
"lighter" and "cleaner" after the procedure, and therefore more able
to eat spicy or sour foods.

However, there's still some chance that the process might cause
temporary injury to my gums or other areas of my mouth, so it'll be
good to be prepared for slight pain and incapacitation for the 2-3
days after the appointment.

### Medical stuff

I already have stocks of over-the-counter acetaminophen and ibuprofen,
so in the (very unlikely) event of excessive pain, I can make use of
these.

### Food plans

#### Food purchase trips

It so happened that the [Berkeley air quality
issues](2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md) hit the week prior,
so as of 2023-09-24, I am very low on food stocks in general, and
likely need multiple trips to get back to a reasonable amount of
excess stock. My current plan is as follows:

* 2023-09-24: One trip to Trader Joe's to get basic stocks
* 2023-09-24: One trip to Berkeley Bowl to stock up on vegan probiotic
  yogurt as well as backup rice (since I used up my backup rice due to
  not going out for a while)
* 2023-09-26: Second trip to Trader Joe's to get additional stocks

#### Food consumption guidance prior to procedure

These are my current thoughts on foods to avoid:

* **No nuts consumption after Sunday September 24**: Nuts have some
  likelihood of causing bite-down injuries, which may make the dental
  cleaning process more painful, so I will skip nuts consumption after
  Sunday September 24.

* **No outside food consumption after Sunday September 24**: As
  outside food poses slightly more risk, I want to not have outside
  food after the planned Udupi Palace takeout on Sunday September 24.

* **No sauerkraut consumption after Sunday September 24** (and
  therefore effectively after ~September 17): As sauerkraut is a bit
  acidic and can cause a sore throat, and I've had issues with it in
  the past, I will stop consuming sauerkraut after September 24. In
  fact since my sauerkraut ran out around September 17 (I don't have
  the exact date) and I haven't consumed it since then, I will have a
  long period with sauerkraut consumption.

These are my thoughts on foods to add in:

* **Vegan probiotic yogurts**: I will resume having vegan probiotic
  yogurts prior to the operation to replace sauerkraut for the
  probiotic benefits. I might have a little extra since I've not had
  sauerkraut for over a week due to finishing it and not going out to
  shop due to the air quality issues, so might be a bit low on
  probiotics anyway.

These are my thoughts on timing:

* **Finish second meals by 8 PM every day starting Saturday September
  23**: This is to keep my digestion in good shape.

  How did I do? I was able to adhere to this!

* **Go to sleep by 11:30 PM every day starting Sunday September 24**:
  This is to promote early sleep/waking and reduce the risk of
  digestive cycle issues on the day of the procedure. My sleep cycle
  was a bit off for the past few days due to staying up late one day
  for a lot of document sorting, so it's important to reset my sleep
  cycle.

  How did I do? I was approximately on time on Sunday September 24 (I
  think I went to sleep just a little after 11:30 PM) and
  significantly delayed on Monday September 25 (I went to sleep around
  2:15 AM on Tuesday). The reason for the delay on Monday was the
  delay related to doing laundry and finishing a work-related task.
  
* **Finish first meal by 11:30 AM on Tuesday September 26**: This will
  make sure my meal cycle is not too far off by the date of the
  appointment (Wednesday).

  How did I do? I couldn't adhere to this. The reason was that I
  wanted to do a grocery trip and given the temperature forecast, it
  made sense to do the grocery trip in the morning rather than in the
  afternoon when it would be hotter. Unfortunately this meant delaying
  my meal, because I also got up a bit late, thanks to having slept
  late the previous day.

#### Meal prep prior to procedure

* I should make sure I'm well-stocked on mixed vegetables prior to the
  procedure.

* I should also make sure I'm well-stocked on cooked potatoes so I can
  resume them as soon as I can have soft solid food.

* I should also make sure I'm well-stocked on cooked peas so I can
  resume them as soon as I can have soft solid food.

#### Food consumption guidance after procedure

The details depend on how my teeth feel after the procedure. I should
be prepared (in terms of food stocks and prepped food) for continuing
to avoid nuts, sauerkraut, and outside food for 2-3 days after the
procedure.

### Sleep plans

As mentioned above, I aim to sleep by 11:30 PM every day starting
Sunday September 24. The goal is to reset my sleep cycle that is a bit
off after staying up late one night due to document organization work,
and also perhaps due to the recent [air quality
issues](2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md).

I also hope to wake up organically around 8:30 AM with natural bowel
movement within 30-45 minutes of waking up. I will set an alarm for
around 9:15 AM except on days where I have earlier appointments.

How did I do? I was approximately on time on Sunday September 24 (I
think I went to sleep just a little after 11:30 PM) and significantly
delayed on Monday September 25 (I went to sleep around 2:15 AM on
Tuesday). The reason for the delay on Monday was the delay related to
doing laundry and finishing a work-related task.

Due to the delay going to sleep Monday night, I was also delayed
getting up on Tuesday morning, getting up a little after 9 AM instead
of by 8:30 AM as I had hoped.

### Exercise plans

#### Break from jogging and strength exercise on Monday September 25, Tuesday September 26, and Wednesday September 27

I plan to skip jogging and strength exercise from Monday September 25
to Wednesday September 27.

However, I do expect to do other outside trips on Monday and Tuesday,
that involve walking both ways and carrying stuff back, so they'll
substitute to some extent for the jogging and strength exercise.

#### Break from hand gripper exercises or stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed exercises only on day of the procedure (Wednesday September 27)

For my hand gripper exercises and stand-on-one-leg-with-eyes-closed
exercises, I intended to take a break only *on* the day of the
procedure, and not prior to it.

#### Resume normal exercises starting Thursday September 28

I plan to resume normal exercises starting Thursday September 28.
