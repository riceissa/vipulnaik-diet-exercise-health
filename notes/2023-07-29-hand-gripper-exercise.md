# 2023-07-29: hand gripper exercise

On July 5, 2023, I placed an order for a set of 3 hand grippers: 100
lb, 150 lb, and 200 lb. I picked the order up on July 8. However,
since I was still recovering from wisdom tooth removal at the time,
and then had antibiotic-induced digestive issues, I did not
immediately start using the hand grippers.

Eventually, on 2023-07-29, I started using the 100 lb hand gripper.

## Observations as of the first few days of using the 100 lb hand gripper

* I can crush the hand gripper fully and consistently when I use both
  hands, with my left hand on one side and my right hand on the other
  side.

* Generally, my right hand seems to have greater grip strength,
  *almost* fully crushing the hand gripper consistently. By my second
  day (2023-07-30) I was able to get my right hand to *fully* crush
  the hand gripper on the first try of each set of tries (e.g., if I
  would wait a few minutes and then try, the first try I would crush
  fully). But even so I was not able to crush it on the second try in
  *most* cases, and never on the third try.

### Update on 2023-08-08

By this time I can consistently and comfortably crush the 100 lb hand
gripper with my right hand. Also, I have been able to occasionally
fully crush the hand gripper with my left hand, but not consistently.

### Update on 2023-09-04

I took a break for a few days before after my wisdom tooth removal
(between Monday 2023-08-21 and Monday 2023-08-28). I resumed on
Tuesday 2023-08-29, but limited to one round per day.

On Monday 2023-09-04, I resumed the use of the 100 lb hand gripper for
multiple rounds a day. I found that now I can comfortably and
consistently close with both hands. With that said, it's still easier
with the right hand.

This led me to experiment (for the first time since I started using
the hand gripper) with the 150 lb hand gripper. Unsurprisingly, I
wasn't able to close this hand gripper with either hand (each hand
individually was only able to partially close up to the "vertical"
stage). With both hands together, I was able to close the 150 lb.
