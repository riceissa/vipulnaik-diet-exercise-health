# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This continues with the spirit of my [2021 activity
tracker](2021-activity-tracker.md), recording my trips outside the
home. I exclude trips for jogging and running. I also exclude trips
for grocery purchases and picking up takeout from restaurants; you can
get a sense for those trips by looking in
[food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Tuesday January 3

In the afternoon, I made a trip to Citibank for some financial
transactions. I finished around 1:35 PM. I then went to Trader Joe's
for food purchases recorded at

## Sunday January 8
