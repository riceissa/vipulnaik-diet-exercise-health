On Tuesday, January 8, 2019, I visited a dentist, Jessica Ngo of Total
Health Dental Care, at 3017 Telegraph Avenue. I had tried to make an
appointment for earlier but this was the earliest available appointment.

The visit was in connection with the [head, neck, jaw and tooth pains
I'd had in December
2018](2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md). However, by the time of
the visit, most of my pain had resolved, so the visit served more as a
general dental health checkup.

## Bureaucracy/paperwork

The appointment was scheduled for 2:50. I arrived at 2:40 and filled
in a bunch of paperwork. Then, I was briefly interviewed by an
administrator who filled in yet more paperwork. 

## X-ray and photos

After that, I was directed to a nurse/assistant who took an X-ray of
my teeth. After the X-ray, she took photos of a number of my teeth in
various positions.

The assistant who did the X-rays said that it was probably more
painful for me because of my small mouth. I think my active tongue
probably made it harder. Still, it went reasonably fine (just probably
longer than for most people, no lasting pains). The part that was
hardest was the X-ray of the area on the far left, near my swelling.

## Doctor examination

The doctor examined me quite briefly. She noted that:

* My gums had swollen throughout, but it was more extreme near my
  lower left teeth (i.e., that wisdom tooth).

* There was a lot of plaque on the inside teeth, though the outside
  was clean. There was also some bleeding when being poked with the
  dental instruments, though I hadn't encountered bleeding on my own.

Her recommendation was to:

* Have my lower left wisdom tooth removed

* Have my teeth scaled/cleaned along with that?

* As part of that process, a gum evaluation to determine whether a
  deep cleaning is necessary

## Cost of visit

The visit was billed at $89.

I also had the option of signing up for a $360 annual membership that
would have made this visit free and given me a 20% discount on later
medical traetments.

## Cost of further treatments

The gum evaluation and wisdom tooth extraction was estimated with the
following cost:

* $832 with nitrous oxide, without annual membership
* $674 without nitrous oxide, without annual membership
* $665.60 wih nitrous oxide, with annual membership
* ~$510 without nitrous oxide, with annual membership

For all of these, a 5% discount for payment made at the time of
reservation.
