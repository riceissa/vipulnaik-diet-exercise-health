# 2023-10-04 eye exam

On Friday 2023-09-15, I called in to the UC Berkeley Optometry Clinic
to schedule an appointment for an eye exam. The appointment was
scheduled for Wednesday 2023-10-04 at 1 PM at the Tang Eye Center,
with appointment duration being 90 minutes (1 PM to 2:30 PM).

I didn't ask about price explicitly, since the price last time of $114
was fairly reasonable, but after the call I realized this so I checked
online. I found [this
page](https://eyecare.berkeley.edu/plan-your-visit/fees-and-insurance/)
that suggests a current price of $129 for a comprehensive eye exam,
which is what I signed up for.

Shortly after booking the appointment, I got an email notification
about it, confirming the details of my booking.

I also added the event to my calendar so as not to forget.
