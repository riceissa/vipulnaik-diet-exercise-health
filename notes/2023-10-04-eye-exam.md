## Appointment booking

On Friday 2023-09-15, I called in to the UC Berkeley Optometry Clinic
to schedule an appointment for an eye exam. The appointment was
scheduled for Wednesday 2023-10-04 at 1 PM at the Tang Eye Center,
with appointment duration being 90 minutes (1 PM to 2:30 PM).

I didn't ask about price explicitly, since the price last time of $114
was fairly reasonable, but after the call I realized this so I checked
online. I found [this
page](https://eyecare.berkeley.edu/plan-your-visit/fees-and-insurance/)
that suggests a current price of $129 for a comprehensive eye exam
(assuming that insurance does not apply), which is what I signed up
for.

Shortly after booking the appointment, I got an email notification
about it, confirming the details of my booking.

I also added the event to my calendar so as not to forget.

## Prior preparation and review on 2023-10-01

### Questions to bring up

* Fundus photos were taken last time to monitor for changes to the
  size ratio of the inner disk and outer disk, since this was
  different between the eyes.
* I'm seeing something in my right eye -- I don't recall this being
  there last time, but perhaps it was -- what is it?
* Photosensitivity is still approximately the same as last time -- any
  further insights on it?
  * It did go up a bit briefly during flashes of tooth pain, masking
    for extended periods of time, or keeping the light on for several
    hours at a time.
* Minor incidents since last meeting:
  * [2022-05-26 onward eye and skin
    irritation](2022-05-26-eye-and-skin-irritation.md): Starting
    2022-05-26, I experienced some eye and skin irritation likely
    triggered by the powder getting into the air when opening a new
    container. I got it under control by frequent eye washing, using
    sunglasses when handling laundry detergent, and keeping laundry
    detergent container in a tight plastic bag and in a closed shelf
    when not using.
  * [2022-06-21 hand sanitizer
    squirt](2022-06-21-hand-sanitizer-squirt.md): On 2022-06-21, I had
    a little bit of hand sanitizer squirt into my eye. I flushed my
    eyes for several minutes and recovered fully within a few hours. I
    made some protocol changes including reducing the height of the
    hand sanitizer (so that even if it squirted, it would not go all
    the way up to my eyes) and checking for and clearing nozzle
    blockages regularly to reduce the risk of unexpected squirts.

### Stuff to take with me for the appointment

The date of the appointment is expected to be sunny and hot, so it's
important to be well-prepared for the journey to and from the
appointment. The return journey will be trickier since my eyes will be
dilated from the appointment.

* Sunglasses: Wear as usual
* Cap: I verified I still have my cap accessible
* Umbrella: I have an umbrella that I can use for further protection
  against the sunlight

### Taking BART: undecided

Taking BART will reduce the duration I have to walk by a little bit,
but not a lot. My current thinking is to not take BART for the journey
*to* the appointment, but possibly to take BART for the return journey
when my eyes will be dilated and it'll be a little harder to walk all
the way back. I will decide based on how I feel after the appointment.

### Food plans

Unlike with a dental cleaning trip, I don't expect any risk factor for
the procedure from any particular kinds of diet, nor do I expect that
the procedure will affect my dietary needs. So I don't plan to do any
special food stocking. So, there is no specific food consumption
guidance for before or after the procedure.

#### Food purchase trips

I'm planning to do a food purchase trip on Sunday October 1 to get
enough groceries and produce to last me for at least 2 days after the
eye exam.

#### Food consumption guidance prior to procedure

My only guidance is related to timing. The goal is to finish the first
meal by 11:30 AM and the last meal by 8 PM each day. This will reduce
the degree of adjustment needed on the day of the procedure. However,
this is only a light guidance, and other constraints may take
precedence.

#### Meal prep prior to procedure

I plan to finish food preparation on Monday and Tuesday that is
expected to last me till at least two days after the procedure. The
goal is that I shouldn't need to do food prep immediately after the
procedure when my eyes won't be in great condition.

### Sleep plans

My plan is to sleep by 11:30 PM starting Saturday September 30. I also
hope to wake up organically around 8:30 AM with natural bowel movement
within 30-45 minutes of waking up. I will set an alarm for around 9:15
AM except on days where I have earlier appointments.

I was able to adhere to this plan on Saturday night / Sunday morning,
and slept nine hours, allowing me to catch up on a slight sleep
backlog.

### Exercise plans

My current plan is to take a break from all exercise on the day of the
eye exam. I might also take a break from exercise on one of the two
days prior to it (Monday or Tuesday) in order to be physically and
mentally relaxed and to have more time for other preparatory steps,
but if I have enough free time I'll probably do the exercise. The
reason for not enforcing an exercise break is that I've had breaks
from exercise for multiple reasons in the past few weeks, so I'm not
in a state of exhaustion/fatigue from exercise.
