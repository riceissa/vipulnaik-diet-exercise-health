# 2023-11-09: upper middle left gum area pain

On 2023-11-09 (possibly a day before or after), I noticed while
brushing the front upper middle left area of my gums that there was
pain in that region. It felt like a mouth ulcer on the mouth side (not
the teeth side) though the situation wasn't totally clear. The pain
continued for a few days, till at least 2023-11-12, but it came up
*only* when I was brushing that area or manually probed it with my
tongue.

There was no clear improvement for a few days; around 2023-11-15 to
2023-11-17 I started noticing clear improvements when probing with my
tongue.
