## Decision to get the booster

For my previous COVID vaccine doses, I was somewhat behind my peer
group in terms of getting the dose. This was most pronounced for my
first and second vaccine dose but also true for my first booster.

In contrast, for the updated booster, I'm a little bit ahead of some
sources of advice, including Zvi Mowshowitz, as noted below.

### Background: advice by Zvi Mowshowitz

* [Meet the New Booster section in the September 1, 2022 COVID post by Zvi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tdsnP3nagQwjib3eg/covid-9-1-22-meet-the-new-booster#Meet_the_New_Booster)
* [Booster Boosting section in the September 8, 2022 COVID post by Zvi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXyBqrHfx3hNvApdn/covid-9-8-22-booster-boosting#Booster_Boosting)

Zvi's criterion as hinted at in the first post, and fleshed out in the
second post, is as follows:

> Essentially, I would get the booster if and only if I was already
> vaccinated, had not been infected or vaccinated/boosted within 6
> months, and either (1) not yet had a first booster or (2) was at
> relatively high risk.

I fit the criteria of being already vaccinated and of not being
infected or vaccinated/boosted within 6 months. However, I don't fit
either (1) or (2), so per Zvi's logic, I shouldn't get a
booster. However, Zvi says of my case that it would be a "small
mistake either way":

> If I had already been vaccinated and boosted more than six months
> ago, and had not to my knowledge been infected in the past 6 months,
> and was not in poor health or are over the age of 50 or so, probably
> no, but it would be a small mistake either way.

### My reasons for being more interested in the booster

I generally agree with Zvi that it would be a "small mistake either
way" to get or not get the updated booster. However, on net I think it
would be a bit less of a mistake to get the booster than to not get
it. There are a few reasons:

* I expect a nontrivial probability of increased social interaction in
  the next few months compared to what I've had in the last 2.5
  years. This comes partly from my change of job, and the existence of
  a physical office and lab space at the new office that I visit
  occasionally. In addition to exposure risks with office mates, I
  also take mass transit to and from the place which exposes me to
  other people.

* In general, people's level of precaution around COVID is falling,
  which is fine given cases at present, but could mean greater risk
  when cases increase. There are some reasons to expect a winter
  surge. Unfortunately, there's a lead time of about two weeks to get
  vaccine appointments so it seems better to get vaccinated prior to
  the winter surge.

* I'm living alone, which increases the costliness of even a minor
  infection in terms of the difficulty e.g. in visiting
  shops. Moreover, my living situation makes home delivery challenging
  (the building where I live has a locked front door that's facing a
  main street, so delivery people can't leave stuff at my door). Thus,
  I impose greater negative value on *getting infected at all* than
  perhaps many other people do.

## Appointment booking (Wednesday October 26)

I used the Walgreens website to book an appointment. The Walgreens
location is close enough to my home. Unfortunately, due to limitations
of the website, I had limited ability to select the appointment date,
so I was limited to picking a date exactly two weeks from now. It so
happened that Wednesday November 9 is a convenient time for a vaccine
appointment, since Wednesday is a no-meeting day at work. So I ended
up making the appointment for 3 PM on Wednesday, November 9, 2022.

## Booster shot (Wednesday November 9)

I left my home around 2:45 PM. I arrived at Walgreens around 2:51
PM. There was a long line at the pharmacy; I wasn't sure if I could
move to the head of the line due to my vacine appointment, so I just
waited in line. I had to fill in a form. I had not carried my COVID
vaccine card (I carry my insurance card always, though I didn't need
to show it). I was asked for my COVID vaccine card, so instead of the
actual card I showed the photo of the card after searching for it in
my email on my phone.

I then waited for the pharmacist to be available to give me my
shot. After some waiting, I got the shot on my right arm. It was a
very small dose.

After finishing receiving the booster shot at around 3:54 PM, I sat
for a few minutes and then did some shopping at the Walgreens that I
had been meaning to do for some time.

I also received a new COVID vaccination card with the new booster dose
listed. So I now have my COVID vaccine information split across two
vaccination cards. I took a picture of the new card and saved it;
after returning home I also stored the new vaccination card carefully.

## Aftereffects: day of vaccine (Wednesday November 9)

While I was feeling a little bit more fatigued in the hours after the
vaccine, it wasn't enough to interfere with my regular activities
until around 9 PM, when fatigue started to set in. I went to sleep at
around 10:20, and by that time, I was feeling a little soreness in my
arm.

## Aftereffects: next day (Thursday November 10)

I semi-woke up early in the morning and was semi-asleep in bed for a
few hours, feeling soreness and shivering and feeling that the
environment was cold compared to my warm body. Around 6:50 AM, I got
out of bed to urinate and also took a temperature reading, that came
to 98.8.

I then went back to sleep and turned off my alarm, so I could get a
proper night's sleep and compensate for some of the twisting and
turning. I finally got up around 9:15 AM and took temperature readings
again. The median reading came to 99.8.

I took another reading around 9:50 AM; my temperature was back down to
98.7. A reading at 1:50 PM came to 99.0.

Throughout the day, I felt a little feverish and sore and had a slight
headache. The fever was mostly cleared by the evening, and the
soreness was clearing out by the time I went to bed around 9:30 PM. My
temperature reading at the time came to 98.3.

## Recovery (Friday November 11)

By the morning of Friday November 11, I was feeling normal. My morning
reading, taken at 7:28 AM, came to 98.0.
