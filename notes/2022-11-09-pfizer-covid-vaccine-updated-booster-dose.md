# 2022-11-09: Pfizer COVID vaccine: updated booster dose

This document describes my experience after receiving the booster dose
of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday, November 9, 2022 at the
Walgreens on Adeline Street.

## Decision to get the booster

For my previous COVID vaccine doses, I was somewhat behind my peer
group in terms of getting the dose. This was most pronounced for my
first and second vaccine dose but also true for my first booster.

In contrast, for the updated booster, I'm a little bit ahead of some
sources of advice, including Zvi Mowshowitz, as noted below.

### Background: advice by Zvi Mowshowitz

* [Meet the New Booster section in the September 1, 2022 COVID post by Zvi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tdsnP3nagQwjib3eg/covid-9-1-22-meet-the-new-booster#Meet_the_New_Booster)
* [Booster Boosting section in the September 8, 2022 COVID post by Zvi](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PXyBqrHfx3hNvApdn/covid-9-8-22-booster-boosting#Booster_Boosting)

Zvi's criterion as hinted at in the first post, and fleshed out in the
second post, is as follows:

> Essentially, I would get the booster if and only if I was already
> vaccinated, had not been infected or vaccinated/boosted within 6
> months, and either (1) not yet had a first booster or (2) was at
> relatively high risk.

I fit the criteria of being already vaccinated and of not being
infected or vaccinated/boosted within 6 months. However, I don't fit
either (1) or (2), so per Zvi's logic, I shouldn't get a
booster. However, Zvi says of my case that it would be a "small
mistake either way":

> If I had already been vaccinated and boosted more than six months
> ago, and had not to my knowledge been infected in the past 6 months,
> and was not in poor health or are over the age of 50 or so, probably
> no, but it would be a small mistake either way.

### My reasons for being more interested in the booster

I generally agree with Zvi that it would be a "small mistake either
way" to get or not get the updated booster. However, on net I think it
would be a bit less of a mistake to get the booster than to not get
it. There are a few reasons:

* I expect a nontrivial probability of increased social interaction in
  the next few months compared to what I've had in the last 2.5
  years. This comes partly from my change of job, and the existence of
  a physical office and lab space at the new office that I visit
  occasionally. In addition to exposure risks with office mates, I
  also take mass transit to and from the place which exposes me to
  other people.

* In general, people's level of precaution around COVID is falling,
  which is fine given cases at present, but could mean greater risk
  when cases increase. There are some reasons to expect a winter
  surge. Unfortunately, there's a lead time of about two weeks to get
  vaccine appointments so it seems better to get vaccinated prior to
  the winter surge.

* I'm living alone, which increases the costliness of even a minor
  infection in terms of the difficulty e.g. in visiting
  shops. Moreover, my living situation makes home delivery challenging
  (the building where I live has a locked front door that's facing a
  main street, so delivery people can't leave stuff at my door). Thus,
  I impose greater negative value on *getting infected at all* than
  perhaps many other people do.

## Appointment booking (Wednesday October 26)

I used the Walgreens website to book an appointment. The Walgreens
location is close enough to my home. Unfortunately, due to limitations
of the website, I had limited ability to select the appointment date,
so I was limited to picking a date exactly two weeks from now. It so
happened that Wednesday November 9 is a convenient time for a vaccine
appointment, since Wednesday is a no-meeting day at work. So I ended
up making the appointment for 3 PM on Wednesday, November 9, 2022.
