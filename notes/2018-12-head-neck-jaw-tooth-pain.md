This document gives a rough timeline and sequence of events for head,
neck, jaw and tooth pains that would lead to setting up a dentist
visit.

## Monday, December 24 (2018-12-24)

On this day, I went out in the rain to Starbucks to get an almond hot
chocolate, and also did a takeout of a vegetarian thali from the
Indian place (Chaat Cafe). I ate the whole meal because I was quite hungry.

That day, I went to sleep early, at around 6:30. On previous days I
had been going to sleep relatively early (around 8 to 9 PM), but this
was even earlier than usual. I got up at 7 AM on the next day
(Tuesday, December 25) but was interrupted a few times by alerts. I
had a minor headache and pains but attributed them to the sleep
interruption.

## Tuesday, December 25 (2018-12-25)

I believe I was feeling somewhat tired (despite sleeping a lot of time
overall) but attributed it to a sleep backlog rather than specific
illness. I had a reasonably productive and quiet day.

I went to sleep at 7:30. I got up around 6:30 or 7, again with some
interruptions.

## Wednesday, December 26 (2018-12-26)

I had a reasonably productive day working from home. I went to sleep
at 8:30. I got up at 4:30 (so normal 8 hours of sleep). I had a bit of
a headache at night, and Googled for more details on tension
headaches. I was suspicious because it was disproportionately
affecting my left side. I wondered also if TMD might be the problem
(given that my jaw was also hurting).

I tried some general relaxation techniques I'm aware of, which reduced
the intensity of the pain.

## Thursday, December 27 (2018-12-27)

I had a reasonably productive day but felt physically lethargic toward
the evening. I was planning to get takeout again but realized that it
was cold and I was feeling lethargic, so I decided to just go home and
eat.

It was a little after dinner that I started feeling toothache
sharply. I identified the pain area as a seemingly swollen gum on my
lower left, but not visible easily to me in the mirror because it was
on the far left. At this point, I was also feeling more dryness and
irritation in my throat.

I went to sleep around 8:45.

I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night, because I could not rest
on my left side due to the pain, and had to basically rest on my right
side almost all night.

I woke up in the middle of the night (partly due to an alert) and
decided to apply a gum astringent that had been provided to me by a
dentist during a visit last year (Himalaya HiOra). This reduced the
pain somewhat. It also caused a lot of salivation. I also applied some
relaxation techniques. I was able to go back to sleep but it was not a
blissful sleep. I woke up around 6 AM.

I Googled a lot and thought the problem might be either TMD or tooth
chipping or gum injury. I doubt it was a cavity but couldn' inspect
myself because of the location.

## Friday, December 28 (2018-12-28)

I continued investigating the situation. I had trouble chewing so I
switched to more liquid foods, while also trying to avoid hot or cold
foods and dilute them with water to make them easier to eat.

I also booked a dentist appointment for Monday, December 31, at [Total
Health Dental Care](https://www.totalhealthdentalcare.com) with
Dr. Allison for 3 PM (only some doctors were available on Monday).

I applied gum astringent (Himalaya HiOra) two more times.

I went to sleep around 8:30.

After reading some advice on sleeping with toothaches, I slept with more
head elevation. While this reduced the tooth pains, it seems to have
made me more uncomfortable in other ways. I eventually went back to
sleeping the normal way.

I woke up a couple times briefly at night, then properly woke up
between 6:30 and 7.

## Saturday, December 29 (2018-12-29)

I gargled with salt water and continued to exercise some dietary
caution.

For lunch, I had lentil-rice (bisi bele bhat) along with salt lassi. I
asked for fewer spices, and also mixed some of the lassi into the
other food to make it less strenuous on the teeth. Otherwise, however,
it was a normal meal.
