# Human bemchmark tracker

This document is for notes on my performance on [human benchmark
tests](https://humanbenchmark.com/). I don't record all scores, just
summaries of my recent and cumulative trends periodically.

## 2024-05-16

So far I've done three tests as logged-in user:

* Typing: 94 wpm, averaging two data points of 85 wpm and 102 wpm
  respectively. This places me at the 94.1th percentile. I have had
  previous practice with this test (before logging in) and obviously
  have a lot of practice typing in real life.

* Sequence memory: 15.4 points, averaging across 19 points; a modal
  around 17-19, and a max of 22. This places me at the 90.9th
  percentile. I have had a fair amount of practice with this test
  before logging in and creating an account; however, on the flip
  side, a few runs of the test, particularly the lower-scoring ones,
  were done in distracted settings.

* Verbal memory: 66.5 points, averaging 65 points and 68 points. This
  places me at the 77.72th percentile. Unlike the typing and sequence
  memory tests, I have not yet had practice with this test prior to
  these two plays.

* Number memory: 14.0 points, with just one play at 14.0 points. This
  places me at the 96.2th percentile. Although I had not had recent
  practice of this test, it does mimic a lot of real-world stuff
  (notably, remembering 2FA tokens for data entry) so I think I do
  have prior practice of this in some sense.
