## Appointment booking (Tuesday December 7)

I had received my second Pfizer COVID vaccine dose on Friday, June 25,
2021, as I had documented
[here](2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md). I was therefore
eligible to receive a booster dose on December 23, 2021 or later, per
the minimum-180-day gap requirement.

On Tuesday, December 7, 2021, amidst increased concerns about omicron,
I decided to book and get my booster sooner rather than later. I had
seen, in past shopping at the Walgreens on Gilman Street, that Pfizer
COVID boosters are available there. My first two doses had been at a
somewhat distant Safeway, but I decided to get the booster from
Walgreens, which was within walking distance.

Another advantage of getting the booster now is that I anticipated
that things would be more relaxed work-wise around late December,
right when I became eligible for the booster, so the adverse impact of
any booster side-effects on my work would be reduced.

As for the exact date of the booster, I thought about both December 23
and December 24. I ultimately picked December 24 as it was a holiday
(Christmas Eve) so the impact on my work would be even less. The next
three days after December 24 are also holidays, and I expect to be
fully recovered by the next working day, December 28.

## Priors

The LessWrong post [Quick Poll: Booster
Reactions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QHBBeSYqdFdnNcFut/quick-poll-booster-reactions)
by Elizabeth informed my priors before getting the booster. I did not
have access to this post when I booked my appointment (it was
published on December 20).

## Impact minimization strategies

I had anticipated some probability of feeling feverish after the
vaccine. I took the following steps to minimize the impact:

* I chose a time of year when things are generally calmer work-wise,
  i.e., the Christmas/New Year's lull.

* I reviewed my pattern of reactions to the [second
  dose](2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md) to know what to
  expect for the third dose; I also read [Quick Poll: Booster
  Reactions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QHBBeSYqdFdnNcFut/quick-poll-booster-reactions).

* I booked the appointment for a Friday where the next three days were
  holidays, so that even if there was an adverse reaction it would be
  less likely to affect the work week where availability requirements
  and activity levels are higher.

* I already had a no-contact infrared thermometer and took frequent
  readings to monitor.

* I scheduled meal prep for the day after the vaccine. Since meal prep
  is a more mechanical activity, I was more confident of being able to
  do it even if I were a little bit unwell.

* Additionally, I kept some relatively mechanical day job work as a
  backup option for the day in case I didn't feel up to doing other
  more exciting things. I did end up doing that mechanical day job
  work, though it took only 30 minutes.

* I made sure I still had and could locate the Tylenol I had purchased
  before my second vaccine dose. My general plan was to *not* take it
  unless the pain was severe. In general, taking painkillers
  preeemptively can dampen immune response, so the painkiller should
  only be taken once the immune response is under way and the pain is
  hard to tolerate.

## Booster shot (Friday December 24)

I left my home around 2:30 PM. I took with me my COVID vaccine card as
well as my insurance card.

I arrived at Walgreens at 2:54 PM. I first went through a checkin
procedure with the pharmacy front desk. It turns out that some of the
information that I thought I had submitted online had not gotten
through, so I had to submit my insurance card in person. I also filled
in the standard form.

Around 3:05 PM, I went to the waiting area outside the vaccination
room. I took off my sweatshirt and double-masked myself (surgical mask
on top of my usual KN95 mask) and wore my sunglasses while I waited.

Around 3:10 PM, I was called inside. I asked for the shot to be given
on my right arm. The process finished in a minute. The pharmacist was
the same person who had given me my flu shot. She then gave me my
COVID vaccine card with the booster information noted at the bottom of
the card. She told me to wait in the waiting area for 15 minutes to
check for side-effects and then head back home.

I waited around 7 minutes and then did some shopping, checking out at
3:23 PM. I ended up leaving a little before the 15-minute mark.

I got back home around 3:50 PM.

It was drizzling for part of my journey to and from the Walgreens, and
I used an umbrella.

### Experience of the booster itself

My subjective experience of the "prick" for this dose was that it was
sharper and more painful than my second dose. This probably had more
to do with things like the exact location, type of needle, and
pharmacist's style than with the dose itself, which should be
identical to the second dose. (Maggie, the pharmacist who administered
the second dose, had said that it depends on the pharmacist's skill
when I had remarked to her that the prick was very light).

I did feel a little bit fatigued for a couple of minutes after the
booster, but this was likely due to my double-masking + sunglasses and
the physical effect of the prick, than the actual stuff injected.

## Aftereffects: day of vaccine (2021-12-24)

### Evening of the booster shot

I felt a few random body aches, similar to what I might get after
vigorous exercise, in the evening. The locations including my lower leg
and stomach. The aches were not enough to meaningfully distract me from
my work. My evening temperature reading was 99.1.

While I would normally do some exercises including weightlifting and
pushups in the evening (I do these exercises on alternate days) I
skipped those exercises to conserve my physical energy and in light of
my soreness.

Other than the slight fever and aches and the skipping of exercise,
the evening of the booster shot was pretty normal. In fact, I'd say my
productivity was higher than on a typical evening. See my [2021-12-24
daily update](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/732)
for more.

### Sleep on the night of the booster shot

My sleep on the night of the booster shot was somewhat fitful. I felt
a mix of feverishness and chills, and some body aches and soreness in
the injection area on my right arm as well as on my legs. Usually my
body is a bit sore when I go to sleep but very relaxed by the time I
wake up, but this time, my body was a bit more sore when I woke up.

## Aftereffects: next day (2021-12-25)

### Early morning

Around 5:48 AM, I woke up to urinate, then took a temperature reading
(got 99.1) and went back to sleep. Frequent urination had also been an
aftereffect of my COVID shot last time.

I got up properly around 7:25 AM. At 7:40 AM I took another
temperature reading and got 100.1.

### Bowel movement

I did not feel the pressure to have a bowel movement right after
waking up, unlike most days. Some time after 9 AM, I decided to try
and get a bowel movement anyway. I got one that was a little less than
usual.

Reduced bowel pressure was something I had also experienced after the
previous COVID dose, and likely reflects the body diverting resources
away from food processing and toward generating the immune response.

A reading I took at 9:43 AM, after my bowel movement, came to 98.5
degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the return of the temperature to a normal
range, my subjective experience had not returned to normal, and I
expect there may be further bouts of fever during the day.

### No morning run

Since it was raining, I couldn't go for my usual morning run. If it
hadn't been raining and had been a bit warmer, I might have gone for a
brief run and walk, but I'm not sure.

### Further readings

I took another normal reading at 11:03 AM (after eating) of 98.2. At
11:55 AM, I took another reading and got 101.1. I retook the reading
after a minute and got 100.4.

I took several other readings through the afternoon/evening. My
temperature kept fluctuating between normal and high, and the
temperature reading did not closely track my subjective experience
over the time period.

## Comparison with last time

Comparing with my [second
dose](2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md), it looks like my
reaction was a little bit *faster* this time, but qualitatively
similar. It remains to be seen whether it also subsides more quickly.
