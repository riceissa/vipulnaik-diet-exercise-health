# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This will be useful in case either I come down with coronavirus, or
somebody in my vicinity does and my activity needs to be tracked.

I exclude trips for jogging and running during which I did not come in
proximity to anybody.

I am making one more change from 2020: I'm also listing nontrivial
contact with people inside my household.

## Sunday January 3

I went for picking up takeout from Mehak Indian Cuisine. For most of

## Friday May 28

### Mental and physical state in the morning

Althouhg I experienced a slightly higher general level of physical
fatigue than usual this morning, it's not clear how much of this was
due to the Pfizer COVID shot and how much of this was due to the huge
amount of walking I had done in the past few days. Mentally, I was as
sharp as ever.

## Friday June 25

In the evening I went to get my COVID shot. My temperature before
leaving was 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

I left my home around 4:05 PM and arrived at the North Berkeley BART
at around 4:13 PM. I took the BART train at around 4:25 PM and arrived
at MacArthur around 4:35 PM. I then walked to the Safeway Pharmacy at
3889 San Pablo Avenue, arriving there at around 4:52 PM. I submitted
my paperwork at 5 PM and then got my Pfizer second dose COVID vaccine
at 5:05 PM.

The dose felt very quick and the prick felt very light to me compared
to flu shots I've had. I asked the pharmacist, Maggie, who said it
depends on the pharmacist's skill (ouch). But she also mentioned that
the dose volume for the Pfizer COVID shot is smaller than for flu
shots.

I waited in the pharmacy till about 5:20 PM (15-minute observation
period). I felt fine, so I left. I took the BART back and arrived at
North Berkeley BART at around 6 PM, and got home a few minutes later.

I wore a new KN95 mask while in BART and while in Safeway, but not for
the entire journey walking back and forth.

My temperature upon my return was 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

I felt perfectly fine but started getting sleepy a little earlier,
which may be related to the vaccine or may be because I slept late the
previous night; in any case I went to sleep around 9 PM. I had a
slight soreness in my arm while sleeping, which actually made me
relieved as I was worried that I hadn't even gotten injected!

## Saturday June 26 and Sunday June 27 morning

### Monitoring for effects of yesterday's COVID vaccine

See
[2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md](2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md)
for details. The TL;DR is that I had a slight temperature increase and
slight aches, but little impact on my mental acuity and little
pain. By Sunday late morning, I had returned to normal
temperature-wise.

## Sunday June 27

In the afternoon, I went to downtown Berkeley. I first went to Trader
Joe's where I bought some groceries, checking out at 2:41 PM. I then
went to Udupi Palace and got a spinach masala dosa.

## Discontinuation of activity tracking for routine trips starting July 1

Starting July 1, I am discontinuing the recording of activity tracking
for routine trips within Berkeley. Trips in scope include trips to
Trader Joe's and the restaurants I order takeout from. I will continue
to record trips to stores for non-food purchases, or trips during
which something significant happens.

There are a couple of reasons for pausing the activity tracker
recording of food purchases:

* COVID community transmission is down to zero, so that particular
  motivation has ended. I have also received both doses of the COVID
  vaccine, further reducing my likelihood of getting infected or
  transmitting the virus.

* I now record food purchases in
  [food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql), which has more
  detail except the timestamp of checkout. I'll start adding timestamp
  of checkout in a comment in the SQL file, thereby making the
  information in the activity tracker redundant.

## Wednesday June 30

### Morning trip to Quest Diagnostics

In the morning, I went to Quest Diagnostics at 2999 Regent Street for
blood work. General context is in the [2021 blood test plans
file](2021-blood-teest-plans.md).

Before leaving my home, I took a temperature reading; it came to 98.4
degrees Fahrenheit.

I left my home a little before 7:30 AM and arrived at the North
Berkeley BART at 7:34 AM. I took the Berryessa train at 7:44 AM and
arrived at Ashby station at around 7:50 AM. I then walked to 2999
Regent Street and did the kiosk checkin, finishing around 8:15 AM. I
then waited, mostly outside, till around 8:25 AM when the counter
person confirmed that my blood tests were being readied. Around 8:30
AM, I was called in and my blood was withdrawn at 8:35 AM.

I left the place around 8:40 AM and walked back to the Ashby BART,
getting there around 9 AM. I took the Richmond train at 9:11 AM,
arrived at North Berkeley BART around 9:16 AM, and then walked home.

I wore my KN95 mask while in BART and while in the Quest Diagnostic
building, but not for large parts of the walking journeys.

Minor tidbits:

* They used 5 tubes even though there were 7 tests. It looks like some
  tests got bundled togethr probably because they were related.
* I asked the nurse how much blood would be used before she withdrew
  it. She just pointed to the tubes and left the addition of volumes
  to me, but she said it's not a lot of blood.
* The blood collection was painful in the moment, but less exhausting
  than the blood tests in December 2016 that left me more depleted.
* After the blood was withdrawn, the nurse suggested keeping the
  bandage for 15 minutes, but I kept it for a few hours.
* The nurse asked me to confirm my name on the stickers she put on all
  the tubes.

### Evening laundry trip

toiletries. I was not in any rush to get them; I just wanted to take a
break, take a walk, noticed a low probability of rain, and so decided
to get rid of a TODO item as well.

I wore a KN95 mask while in the store, but not for the journey back
and forth.

I completed my checkout at 5:47 PM. I should have received a digital
receipt by email but haven't yet received it.
