# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This will be useful in case either I come down with coronavirus, or
somebody in my vicinity does and my activity needs to be tracked.

I exclude trips for jogging and running during which I did not come in
proximity to anybody.

I am making one more change from 2020: I'm also listing nontrivial
contact with people inside my household.

## Friday June 25

In the evening I went to get my COVID shot. My temperature before
leaving was 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

I left my home around 4:05 PM and arrived at the North Berkeley BART
at around 4:13 PM. I took the BART train at around 4:25 PM and arrived
at MacArthur around 4:35 PM. I then walked to the Safeway Pharmacy at
3889 San Pablo Avenue, arriving there at around 4:52 PM. I submitted
my paperwork at 5 PM and then got my Pfizer second dose COVID vaccine
at 5:05 PM.

The dose felt very quick and the prick felt very light to me compared
to flu shots I've had. I asked the pharmacist, Maggie, who said it
depends on the pharmacist's skill (ouch). But she also mentioned that
the dose volume for the Pfizer COVID shot is smaller than for flu
shots.

I waited in the pharmacy till about 5:20 PM (15-minute observation
period). I felt fine, so I left. I took the BART back and arrived at
North Berkeley BART at around 6 PM, and got home a few minutes later.

I wore a new KN95 mask while in BART and while in Safeway, but not for
the entire journey walking back and forth.

My temperature upon my return was 98.6 degreess Fahrenheit.

I felt perfectly fine but started getting sleepy a little earlier,
which may be related to the vaccine or may be because I slept late the
previous night; in any case I went to sleep around 9 PM. I had a
slight soreness in my arm while sleeping, which actually made me
relieved as I was worried that I hadn't even gotten injected!

## Saturday June 26

I felt fine in the morning; very slight soreness continued and a
general slight physical fatigue and small aches (the kind you get
after extensive exercise). My temperature was 98.8 degrees
Fahrenheit. I decided I will not run too much this morning, because
even though I'm feeling fine so far I might need to direct more of my
energy to fighting the pseudovirus.

When I actually went to run, I did in fact run a little bit but at the
lower end of usual; I walked around as much as usual though.
