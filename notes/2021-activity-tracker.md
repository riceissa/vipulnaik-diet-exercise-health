# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This will be useful in case either I come down with coronavirus, or
somebody in my vicinity does and my activity needs to be tracked.

I exclude trips for jogging and running during which I did not come in
proximity to anybody.

I am making one more change from 2020: I'm also listing nontrivial
contact with people inside my household.

## Sunday January 3 takeout from Mehak Indian Cuisine

I went for picking up takeout from Mehak Indian Cuisine. For most of
the journey both ways, I was talking on the phone. I was not close to
any humans during the journey, and I lowered my mask for much of the
trip (except when close to people).

My interaction at the restaurant was minimal (just a few words, less
than a minute) and masked.
