# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This will be useful in case either I come down with coronavirus, or
somebody in my vicinity does and my activity needs to be tracked.

I exclude trips for jogging and running during which I did not come in
proximity to anybody.

I am making one more change from 2020: I'm also listing nontrivial
contact with people inside my household.

## Sunday January 3 takeout from Mehak Indian Cuisine

I went for picking up takeout from Mehak Indian Cuisine. For most of
the journey both ways, I was talking on the phone. I was not close to
any humans during the journey, and I lowered my mask for much of the
trip (except when close to people).

My interaction at the restaurant was minimal (just a few words, less
than a minute) and masked.

## Thursday January 7

I went to downtown Berkeley. My first stop was the post office, where
I spent around 20 minutes printing postage and mailiing forms. This
was roughly 4:35 PM to 4:55 PM.

I then went to the Walgreens at downtown Berkeley and bought a few
items. I finished checkout at 5:07 PM.

I then went to Trader Joe's to buy groceries. I finished checkout at
5:28 PM.

I finally went to Udupi Palace to order a spinach masala dosa. It was
a fairly long wait, and there were other people waiting in the area as
well. I was indoors for about 10 to 15 minutes with others (not very
close to me, all masked). I did the rest of my waiting outdoors. I
finally left the restaurant with my order at around 6:25 PM.
