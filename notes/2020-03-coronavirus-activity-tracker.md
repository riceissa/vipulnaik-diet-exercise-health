# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This will be useful in case either I come down with coronavirus, or
somebody in my vicinity does and my activity needs to be tracked.

I exclude trips for jogging and running during which I did not come in
proximity to anybody.

## Monday March 23

* Around 12:30 to 1:30: I went to Walgreens and purchased toilet paper
  and paper towels (two rolls each). The cashier there was the regular
  person and I can recognize his picture. I paid by card.

* Around 5:30 to 7: I went to Trader Joe's and purchased a number of
  groceries. I had to wait in line to enter the store, maintaining six
  feet distance. After purchasing, I went to withdraw cash from the
  Citibank ATM.

## Wednesday March 25

* Around 1 PM: I went to Bangkok Thai Cuisine and ordered yellow curry
  tofu to go. I paid by cash. The server was one of the regular
  people and I can recognize her.

## Saturday March 28:

* Around 1:57 PM: I went to Bangkok Thai Cuisine and ordered yellow
  curry tofu to go. I waited in the restaurant (server wasn't near me
  while I waited) and got the food arond 2:05 PM. The server was the
  same one whom I saw on Wednesday March 25. There were also other
  patrons who picked up orders but I did not get close to them.
