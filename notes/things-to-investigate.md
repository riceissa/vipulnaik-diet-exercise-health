# Things to investigate

List last updated: 2024-10-20

## Supplements

* Omega-3: recent changes to
  [dose](../events/2024/2024-09-25-decision-to-increase-omega-3-supplement-daily-dose.md)
  and
  [diversity](../events/2024/2024-09-28-decision-to-experimentally-add-another-omega-3-supplement.md). Need
  to figure out if new regimen is for the long term. Blood test
  results may influence the decision.

* Atrantil: used 2024-10-09 to 2024-10-16, then paused and resumed
  2024-10-19 onward for plan of up to 20 days. Need to re-evaluate
  after that. Doc
  [here](../events/2024/2024-10-02-atrantil-purchase.md)

* n-acetylcysteine (+ selenium) supplement
  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OUQ3S/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1
  has been siting in Amazon cart. It can help with acetaminophen
  toxicity and seems good to have in general, but need to do more
  research. No doc yet.

* L-lysine supplement
  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BVTNNL7T/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3R3S1UQYGX6C0&psc=1
  is sitting in my Amazon cart.

* Creatine supplement (deferred for now as I want to focus on the most
  important amino acids first).

## Tests

* Refine [2025 blood test
  plans](../events/2025/2025-blood-test-plans.md) and maybe do some of
  the tests sooner if they are decision-relevant. In particular, CMP
  (to confirm BUN stuff is back to normal), omega-3 (to decide whether
  supplement regimen needs further changes), and lipid panel (to see
  if changes since last test have paid off in measurements) may be
  worth doing sooner.

* NMR lipoprofile: I want to get this done at some point; the question
  is whether I should do this instead of a regular lipid panel as part
  of my upcoming round or defer it to a later round. I need to do more
  research and learning regarding NMR lipoprofile and its benefits.

* Look into DEXA scans. For instance, whole-body scans by BodySpec (see
  [here](https://www.bodyspec.com/blog/post/dexa_faq)) or do I want a
  more specialized one? I likely only need one every 5 years or so if
  it comes out okay.

## Data analysis

* Take a fresh look at my 23andme data

## Procedures

* Gum tissue graft -- get a deeper understanding of what the process
  involves and decide whether and when to do a specialist consultation
  and what questions to cover in the consultation.

## Best practices docs to write

* Eye irritation

* Dental pain (both spontaneous and after procedures)

* Cold and flu

* Anal irritation (overlaps with and should link to intense and hard food consumption doc)
