# Things to investigate

List last updated: 2024-10-20

Time on these things would be in a mix of personal chores and other
activities buckets. The other activities bucket would be used for
general learning, including watching YouTube videos. The personal
chores bucket would be for focused work for my own health, including
best practices documentation, event logging, purchasing supplements
and tests, going to get the tests, documenting the results, etc.

The work can further be classified as time-sensitive (triggered by
currently occurring issues) versus non-time-sensitive (most other
exploratory stuff). The (personal chores bucket, non-time-sensitive)
stuff I generally try to do on weekdays only. The other buckets I can
do on weekdays or weekends. The other activities bucket stuff is
limited to 2 hours per day as it falls under POCS; see [best practices
around exertion and
stimulation](../best-practices/best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation.md).

My goal is to be sufficiently forward-thinking with this list that I
investigate and consolidate knowledge before it becomes
time-sensitive.

## Supplements

* Omega-3: recent changes to
  [dose](../events/2024/2024-09-25-decision-to-increase-omega-3-supplement-daily-dose.md)
  and
  [diversity](../events/2024/2024-09-28-decision-to-experimentally-add-another-omega-3-supplement.md). Need
  to figure out if new regimen is for the long term. Blood test
  results may influence the decision.

* Atrantil: used 2024-10-09 to 2024-10-16, then paused and resumed
  2024-10-19 onward for plan of up to 20 days. Need to re-evaluate
  after that. Doc
  [here](../events/2024/2024-10-02-atrantil-purchase.md).

* n-acetylcysteine (+ selenium) supplement
  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OUQ3S/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&psc=1
  ordered; planning to experiment at some point. It can help with
  acetaminophen toxicity and seems good to have in general, but need
  to do more research. No doc yet.

* L-lysine supplement
  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BVTNNL7T/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?smid=A3R3S1UQYGX6C0&psc=1
  ordered; planning to experiment at some point.

* Creatine supplement (deferred for now as I want to focus on the most
  important amino acids first).

## Tests

* Refine [2025 blood test
  plans](../events/2025/2025-blood-test-plans.md) and maybe do some of
  the tests sooner if they are decision-relevant. In particular, CMP
  (to confirm BUN stuff is back to normal), omega-3 (to decide whether
  supplement regimen needs further changes), and lipid panel (to see
  if changes since last test have paid off in measurements) may be
  worth doing sooner.

* NMR lipoprofile: I want to get this done at some point; the question
  is whether I should do this instead of a regular lipid panel as part
  of my upcoming round or defer it to a later round. I need to do more
  research and learning regarding NMR lipoprofile and its benefits.

* Look into DEXA scans. For instance, whole-body scans by BodySpec (see
  [here](https://www.bodyspec.com/blog/post/dexa_faq)) or do I want a
  more specialized one? I likely only need one every 5 years or so if
  it comes out okay.

## Data analysis

* Take a fresh look at my 23andme data

## Procedures

* Gum tissue graft -- get a deeper understanding of what the process
  involves and decide whether and when to do a specialist consultation
  and what questions to cover in the consultation.

## Best practices docs to write

* Eye irritation

* Dental pain (both spontaneous and after procedures)

* Cold and flu

* Eye exam (preparatory steps)
