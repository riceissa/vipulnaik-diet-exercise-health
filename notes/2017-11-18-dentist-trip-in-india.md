# 2017-11-18: dentist trip in India

On 2017-11-18, I went to a dentist in Bengaluru to get a dental
cleaning. These are the notes from the dentist.

```
Vipul Naik
grade II plaque accumulation
Advised oral prophylaxis and followup
and bleaching & discolored teeth
Rec
  - Hiora G.A.
    gum astringent
```

I did use the astringent and carried it with me to the US, where I
would use it later in 2018 duuring my toothache (see
[2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md](2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md) for details).
