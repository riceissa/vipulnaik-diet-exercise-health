# 2024-01: garlic-flavored olive oil and sore throat

In 2024-01, as I was running out of olive oil at home and the Trader
Joe's was out of stock on its usual olive oil, I bought three 250 ml
bottles of garlic-flavored olive oil. As I started consuming the
bottles, I noticed that my throat got a little more sore after
eating. The soreness was intermittent and not too irritating, so I
didn't connect it immediately with the garlic; however, upon more
reflection on 2024-01-27 and 2024-01-28 (when my
[fast](2024-01-27-unplanned-22-hour-fast.md) seems to have exacerbated
things), it seems tied to the garlic flavor.

I've now stocked up on the regular olive oil, and I've just finished
two bottles, so for now I will switch back to regular olive oil. I
might use a little bit of the garlic-flavored oil from time to time
for seasoning on top but not for the base of the preparation (which is
where the quantative majority of oil is).
