# 2024-02-08: red chutney, walnuts, and throat irritation

On 2024-02-08, at night, I decided to finish up a red chutney that had
been left over from a previous Udupi Palace trip. Some combination of
the red chutney and a sharp edge of a walnut I ate caused a slight
irritation in the back of my mouth. The irritation faded out (though
not completely) by the time I went to sleep, but the next morning it
felt like it had moved down into my throat. This was not like a
typical sore throat but felt like a more local and specific
irritation.
