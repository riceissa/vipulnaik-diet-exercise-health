## Preparations the previous two days

### Reduced exercise, to conserve energy and reduce risks

* I did not do weights and pushups for the two days prior to the
  appointment. My last weights/pushups was on Sunday 2023-07-02.

* I did not go out jogging the day prior to the appointment. The last
  time I went jogging was on the morning of Monday 2023-07-03, a
  little over two days prior to the appointment.

### Getting on top of personal chores to reduce personal chores load immediately following the appointment

As you can see from my [daily-updates issue for Tuesday
2023-07-04](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1255) I
spent the day doing a bunch of personal chores, including food prep
and laundry, so that I was as well-set as possible to not need to do
personal chores immediately after the appointment. I also did a bunch
of related shopping on Monday 2023-07-03 (see [daily-updates issue for
Monday
2023-07-03](https://github.com/vipulnaik/daily-updates/issues/1254)). There
were three reasons to split to have the outside stuff on Monday and the
home stuff on Tuesday:

* Tuesday is the Fourth of July so some places may be closed; it
  seemed better to do all outside shopping on Monday.

* There were some dependencies where some of the stuff purchased was
  needed for the stuff at home; specifically, a lot of the food
  purchases were necessary for the food prep.

* I wanted to minimize vigorous out-of-the-home exertion the day
  before the appointment; I thought that just doing stuff at home was
  less likely to be fatiguing (this was approximately true, though I
  underestimated the amount of stuff I ended up having to do at home).

### Clearing out a bunch of things to reduce the risk of things coming up Wednesday

I wanted to reduce the chances that stuff would come up Wednesday that
might distract me from the operation or inconvenience others due to me
being unavailable. So I spent some time Monday and Tuesday clearing
out the things I needed to do Wednesday, either doing them in advance
of Wednesday or postponing them to later.

## Arrival at office

I took BART from Ashby to 19th Street Oakland and then walked over to
the Rotunda Treatment Center, where I arrived around 12:25 PM. I then
filled in various intake forms and was done around 12:35 PM, after
which I sat down and waited. I kept my eyes closed and relaxed for
most of my waiting time though I did check email and Slack quickly. I
switched my phone to a Do Not Disturb mode at 12:50 PM.

## X-rays

I was called in at 1:01 PM by a female doctor for dental X-rays, which
I completed. After that, I went to the operation area and lay down on
the dentist's chair.

## Operation process

### Explanation

Soon, [Dr. James
Connors](https://totalhealthdentalcare.com/james-connors), the lead
doctor for the surgery, arrived. He confirmed that I'll be getting my
left side teeth removed and that I've opted in to laughing gas and
local anesthesia.

He said I should expect a day of bleeding, a week of pain, and a month
of healing.

He also said that my teeth weren't impacted so this is expected to be
a straightforward process and should take under 10 minutes.

### Laughing gas

Dr. Connors and the female doctor who had taken my X-ray then
proceeded to fit the nasal mask on me for laughing gas
administration. They also put a little bit of gel on my lower and
upper left area of my gumline. They left me alone with it for a while.

The female doctor checked in after a few minutes and Dr. Connors
checked in again after about 5 minutes. Everything seemed fine.

### Local anesthesia

The doctors then injected the local anesthesia into the lower and
upper left area of my gumline. Again, they left me for a little while
after that for the anesthesia to take effect.

After they came back, they checked again how things were going. I
noticed some numbness in my right hand and foot, and I wasn't sure if
this is due to the laughing gas or the local anesthesia. Dr. Connors
suspected it's the laughing gas, and that it should subside after I'm
taken off of it. However, upon further thought I think this is more
likely an effect of local anesthesia. This is based on additional
anecdotes as well as the fact that the effect was only on my right
side; we know that the left face maps to the right side of the body,
and the local anesthetic was on the left side, whereas the laughing
gas inhalation should have affected both sides uniformly.

### Actual removal

After they were confident that the local anesthesia had taken effect,
they topped it a little bit and then proceeded with the wisdom tooth
extraction.

To begin with, Dr. Connors gave me a mouth prop that he installed
between the teeth on my right side in order to prop my mouth wide
open, to make it easier for them to extract.

Then they began the extraction. I closed my eyes for the actual
procedure. I didn't experience pain in the dental area itself; the
main unpleasant sensation was the sensation of significant physical
force during the extraction process. The extractions themselves
happened quickly.

### Gauze application

After the removal, I was taken off of the laughing gas. The female
doctor applied gauze in the area and gave me post-operation
instructions as well as some additional gauze, a syringe, and a cold
pack. She also provided some verbal clarifications around the
instructions.

## Exit process

After I left the operating room, I sat down in the waiting area so I
could review the instructions to see if I had any further questions.

### Booking of followup appointment

I booked a followup appointment for Wednesday August 16 at 1 PM. The
followup appointment was somewhat cheaper as there was no need for the
X-ray step that had been completed in this appointment.

I also got confirmation that the additional medication had been sent
to the Walgreens (at Adeline Street) and checked that the office is
open till 4:40 PM in case there's some issue with the medication.

I finally exited the office around 1:54 PM.

## Walgreens trip

### Initial trip

I arrived at the Walgreens a little after 2:15 PM. The pharmacy was
temporarily closed, so I waited in line for it to open. When my turn
came, the person at the counter said that my order has been received
but has not yet been prepared because they're a little behind. He
asked me to come in an hour (around 3:30 PM).

### Second trip

I made my second trip to Walgreens shortly after 3:30
PM. Unfortunately there was a long line at the Walgreens so I stood
there for a long time. I got three of the four prescriptions. The
prescriptions I received were as follows:

* Hydrocodone / acetaminophen: 10 tablets with the instruction to
  "take 1 tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain"

* Ibuprofen 800 mg: 20 tablets with the instruction to "take 1 tablet
  by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain"

* Clindamycin 300 mg: 28 tablets with the instruction to "take 1
  capsule by mouth four times daily for 7 days"

The fourth prescription was marked pending as a
confirmation/clarification was needed from the prescribing doctor.

## Bleeding and gauze changes

### Summary of gauze changes

| Gauze index | Start time | End time | Duration in minutes (approx) |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 1:40 PM | 2:45 PM | 65 |
| 2 | 2:45 PM | 3:05 PM | 20 |
| 3 | 3:05 PM | 3:30 PM | 25 |
| 4 | 3:30 PM | 4:45 PM | 75 |
| 5 | 4:45 PM | 6:00 PM | 75 |
| 6 | 6:00 PM | 7:05 PM | 65 |

### Bleeding prior to my return home

Shortly before arriving at the Walgreens for the first trip (coming
straight from the Rotunda Treatment Center), I experienced a bit of
drooling. I wiped the drool off with a tissue, then masked up before
entering the Walgreens. While in line at the Walgreens, I experienced
more drooling; this time the drooling was harder to control and it
just landed inside my mask. It didn't feel too bad or painful (my
local anesthesia had still not worn off) but when I exited the
Walgreens and took off my mask, I saw blood on the nose bridge. I also
saw bloody saliva dripping down my neck and a bit of it on my
sweatshirt. I masked up again to prevent blood falling around, then
got back home.

### Gauze changes at home

By the time I got a chance to change my gauze, it was about 2:45 PM,
it had been about an hour since my first gauze (as applied in the
operating room) and I hadn't had a chance to change because I had not
gotten back home. I hastily unpacked the gauzes provided and switched
my gauze. In my haste, I did not read/remember the instructions
carefully so I also spat out some blood beyond just drooling it out.

I then did two more changes of gauze over the nezt 45 minutes: At
around 3:30 PM, I was on my fourth gauze when I headed out. By this
time I was getting the hang of it, drool out and clear the excess
blood/saliva but try to not spit because the force of spitting can get
in the way of blood clot formation.

I had to throw out the mask I had used for my first trip, since it was
bloody and messy. So I used a new mask.

By around the time of my departure, of 3:30 PM, the anesthetic
appeared to have worn off fully, at least in the sense that I was no
longer feeling numb.

### Return from second Walgreens trip

When I came back from my second Walgreens trip around 4:45 PM, I found
that the mask had only a slight stain, so I kept it around for further
trips over the next day or two, though I expect to throw this one out
after that as well.

I then changed my gauze again, so I was now on my fifth gauze. But
upon doing so I noticed that the pack that the Rotunda Treatment
Center gave me had only one additional gauze left.

### Third Walgreens trip to stock up on more gauze

In panic about what might happen if I used up all my gauzes and the
bleeding still hadn't stopped, I made another trip to Walgreens to buy
more gauze. This time my trip wasn't to the pharmacy but the regular
counter, so it was much quicker.

### Sixth gauze use

After returning from Walgreens, I switched to my sixth gauze around 6
PM. This time, I used one of the pieces of gauze that I had just
purchased from Walgreens rather than the one the dentist gave me -- I
wanted to leave the dentist's gauze for last and try the Walgreens one
to see if it worked well.

### Removal of sixth gauze

Around 7:05 PM, I removed my sixth gauze and then kept no gauze inside
for a while. Since heavy bleeding had stopped, I wanted to see if not
having a gauze could help with clot formation faster. In any case I
wanted to drink some soup with my antibiotics soon and I couldn't do
that with a gauze, so I removed the gauze to see how bad the bleeding
situation was.

### Seeming improvement after removal of gauze

After the removal of gauze, I felt that my recovery proceeded more
smoothly. It's hard to separate correlation and causation: I felt
comfortable removing the gauze because things were improving, but the
removal of the gauze may also have helped improve things.

## Application of ice pack

### First application starting 2023-07-05 at 7:10 PM

I applied my regular Wellbox ice pack starting 7:10 PM or so, shortly
after removing my sixth gauze. Even though there wasn't any swelling
yet, the online resources I had read suggested that applying an ice
pack within the first 24 hours could help reduce the risk of swelling
later, and it wasn't much use to apply it later after the swelling had
already started. My plan is to apply the ice pack for 15-20 minutes at
a time.

### Second application starting 2023-07-05 around 10 PM

Shortly after 10 PM, I applied the ice pack again for about 15 minutes.

### Third application starting 2023-07-06 around 1:20 AM

Around 1:20 AM, I applied the ice pack for a little over 10 minutes.

#### Fourth application starting 2023-07-06 around 1:15 PM

Around 1:15 PM, I applied the ice pack for about 15 minutes.

## Consumption of medications

Medication | Total number | Number consumed | Suggested gap between consumptions | Last consumption
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
hydrocodone / acetaminophen | 10 | 6 | 6 hours | 2023-07-08 around 1:30 PM
ibuprofen 800 mg | 20 | 6 | 6 hours | 2023-07-08 around 1:30 PM
clindamycin | 28 | 6 | not explicit, but target 4 per day | 2023-07-08 around 1:30 PM

### Pain medications on 2023-07-05 5 PM

On 2023-07-05 around 5 PM, I had, along with water:

* 1 tablet of hydrocodone / acetaminophen

* 1 tablet of ibuprofen 800 mg

I did not have the clindamycin just yet, as I wanted to have it once I
was home for a more extended period of time, and possibly along with
some food to replenish myself.

### Clindamycin on 2023-07-05 8 PM

On 2023-07-05 around 8 PM, shortly after starting my cool liquid foods
dinner (about 5 minutes into the start of the meal), I took one capsule
of clindamycin along with water. See a [later section](#meals) for details
regarding my meals.

### All three medications on 2023-07-06 shortly after midnight

On 2023-07-06 shortly after midnight, I had, along with water and the
"cool liquid foods" meal I was having:

* 1 capsule of clindamycin

* 1 tablet of hydrocodone / acetaminophen

* 1 tablet of ibuprofen 800 mg

### All three medications on 2023-07-06 between 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM

On 2023-07-06, between 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM, I had, along with water
and the "cool liquid foods" meal I was having:

* 1 capsule of clindamycin

* 1 tablet of hydrocodone / acetaminophen

* 1 tablet of ibuprofen 800 mg

### All three medications on 2023-07-06 around 6:45 PM

On 2023-07-06, around 6:45 PM, I had, along with water and my first
"soft solid food" meal I was having:

* 1 capsule of clindamycin

* 1 tablet of hydrocodone / acetaminophen

* 1 tablet of ibuprofen 800 mg

### No more further notes

I expect to take the medications with every meal. I'll continue to
update the table at the beginning of this section with my number
consumed and latest consumption, but will stop recording notes for
each round of medication consumption as it's predictable and
repetitive.

## Food

### Cool liquid food for dinner on 2023-07-05 around 8 PM to 9 PM

I had a slow dinner with cool liquid foods on 2023-07-05 starting a
little before 8 PM and ending a little after 9 PM. This was my first
meal after the operation.

I had originally thought I might just skip having anything for 24
hours after the operation, but it seemed like an empty stomach was not
a good idea for the antibiotic (clindamycin). Also, I was at least
somewhat hungry/thirsty; the bleeding would also have led to the loss
of some nutrients so refurbishing them was important.

My "cool liquid foods" dinner was obtained by mixing almond milk, miso
soup, and tomato soup. I had about 6-8 cups of the mix. I consumed it
one spoon at a time, sipping very gently. I really enjoyed the meal
and felt it was soothing to my recovering wisdom tooth area. It was
also emotionally helpful with my recovery. The slow pace of drinking
was also helpful for me to relax and refocus. At the end of it, I felt
better.

I did not do any brushing, rinsing, or flossing after the meal.

### Cool liquid food for second dinner on 2023-07-06 from shortly after midnight to about 1 AM

I had another slow meal of cool liquid foods, starting a little after
midnight on 2023-07-06 and ending a little after 1 AM. The composition
and format of the meal was very similar to my preceding meal.

### Cool liquid foods for breakfast on 2023-07-06 between 10:30 AM and 11:30 AM

I had another slow meal of cool liquid foods, starting a little after
10:30 AM on 2023-07-06 and ending around 11:30 AM. The composition and
format of the meal was very similar to my first two meals. One
difference was that along with this meal, in addition to my
medications, I also took my daily supplements.

### Soft solid food for dinner on 2023-07-06 between 6 PM and 7 PM

I had a meal of soft solid food around 6 PM on 2023-07-06. The items in the meal include:

* Cut and cooked potatoes from Tuesday (not literally mashed, but still fairly soft)
* Cooked peas from Tuesday
* Mixed vegetables cooked on Tuesday

In addition, I continued to mix in almond milk and miso soup. I did
not include tomato soup this time as tomatoes were in any case part of
the mixed vegetables so adding tomato soup as well would be overkill.

I mixed the medications in near the end of the meal, around 6:45 PM.

### Soft solid food for breakfast/brunch on 2023-07-07 between 11 AM and 12 PM

I had a meal of soft solid food starting 11 AM on 2023-07-07. The
composition and format of the meal was similar to that of my previous
dinner. I also took my daily supplements as well as prescribed
medications along with this meal.

### Soft solid food for dinner on 2023-07-07 between 5 PM and 6 PM

I had a meal of soft solid good starting 5 PM on 2023-07-07. The
composition and format of the meal was similar to my previous two
meals. I took two of the medications (ibuprofen and clindamycin)
skipping acetaminophen + hydrocodone.

### Almost normal food for lunch 2023-07-08 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM

At 1:30 PM, I had lunch. Unlike with previous meals, this time I
included whole wheat tortillas as part of my meal, thereby also
reducing the amount of potatoes that I had in this meal. Along with
the food, I took all three medications (ibuprofen, acetaminophen +
hydrocodone, clindamycin).

I also took a temperature measurement after the meal, coming to 98.8
degrees Fahrenheit for my central forehead. After the temperature
measurement, I felt like my heart was beating fast, so I tried to
measure my pulse to get a crude estimate of my heart rate. My rough
measure came to around 80 beats per minute, i.e., well under the
official threshold for tachycardia (of 100 beats per minute), but
likely higher than *my* average.

I did some EFT tapping and relaxed breathing for a little while and
then re-measured my heart rate around 3:25 PM; this time I got a rate
closer to 60 beats per minute. So perhaps the spike in heart rate was
temporary; nonetheless it happening right after taking food +
medications suggests that it's something in the food + medications,
and my guess is it's the antibiotic (clindamycin). I also re-measured
my temperature and got 98.2 / 98.4.

## Sleep

### Sleep at night on 2023-07-05 (or rather, past midnight on 2023-07-06)

I deliberately delayed going to sleep after my wisdom tooth removal
appointment, so that my teeth were further ahead in the healing
process; during sleep, because of my reduced awareness, I am slightly
more at risk for injuring them, so it felt important to delay sleep.

I finally went to sleep around 1:30 AM, by which time I felt tired and
also felt that my healing was far enough ahead.

I slept on my right side and with my pillow slightly raised. As far as
I can make out, I was able to spend most of the night sleeping on my
right side, with small segments spent sleeping on my back. I vaguely
remember almost switching to sleeping on my left side around 6 AM and
then remembering not to. I didn't check the time; just guessing the
time based on the level of illumination.

I got semi-awake around 7:30 AM but then continued to sleep in. At
8:40 AM, I preemptively paused my alarm for 8:45 AM. I got out of bed
around 9:10 AM.

Despite having spent most of the night sleeping on my right side, I
did not feel any pain on my right side.

### Sleep at night on 2023-07-06 (or rather, past midnight on 2023-07-07)

I went to sleep around 2:30 AM on 2023-07-07, and got up around 9
AM. For the entire duration, I slept on my right side. I did not
elevate my pillow as much as last time, so other than sleeping only on
my right side, this was a normal sleep for me.

The reason for sleeping so late was to continue to put a decent gap
between time of surgery and the time of sleep. However, beyond 2 days,
I expect this consideration to be minimal. So, I expect to return to an
earlier sleep / earlier wake-up pattern starting the night of Friday
2023-07-07.

### Fitful sleep on the night of 2023-07-07

I went to sleep around 11:45 PM on 2023-07-07, moving my sleep time
closer to normal after staying up late for the first two days. I
experienced some bad symptoms, none of them seemingly directly related
to the area of surgery.

* Even before going to bed, I felt a little colder than usual. The
  ambient night temperature of about 61 degrees fahrenheit / 16
  degrees celsius was a little lower than comparable night
  temperatures of the past few days, so it wasn't clear how much this
  was just an objective read of the environment.

* After a little while in bed, I felt I had some form of tachycardia,
  i.e., my heart was beating faster than usual, even though there
  didn't seem to be any mental/emotional source of excitement that
  could be driving it.

* I also felt like my stomach was heavy and a bit cramped.

I continued to sleep, only on my right side.

I woke up around 5 AM, urinated, and tried but failed to pass stool. I
also noticed that I had drooled a bit in my sleep -- something I
hadn't done in the last two days, though there had been some past
incidents of drooling. I took another temperature reading and it came
to 98.3. I also noticed that when trying and failing to pass stool, my
left leg went to sleep, though I was able to get it back to normal
within a few seconds of getting back up on my feet.

I switched my pillow side and went to sleep. Around 6 AM, on a hunch,
I decided to switch to sleeping on my left side. Correlation isn't
obviously causation, but it did seem like allowing myself to make that
switch was helpful to my comfort level.

I was still a bit sleepy (though gradually waking up) when the 8:45 AM
alarm rung. After I stopped the alarm, I slept in for another 30
minutes or so, then woke up properly. I urinated, then took another
temperature reading; this one came to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. I then
did some morning checks (email, messages, Slack, etc.) then
successfully passed stool. Again, my left leg went to sleep while
passing stool, but this effect was less extreme than the time I tried
and failed to pass stool earlier in the day.

After passing stool and spending some time on my computer, I took
another temperature reading and it came to 98.0. By this time I was
feeling normal as well.

#### Possible explaantions

There are several possibilities to explain the various symptoms; in
fact different symptoms may correspond to different explanations:

* Food: The composition and format of my food is different from usual,
  and this could be affecting my stomach. In particular, I've noticed
  that increasing my potato consumption and miso soup consumption has
  led to very minor stomach cramps before, so the even more
  significant increase to these two in the last few days could explain
  the stomach side of things.

  More specifically, my food differs from usual in these respects:

  * More protein than usual: I've been having a bunch of potatoes,
    peas, and almond milk, more than usual; all of these have a bunch
    of protein (particularly the peas).

  * Fewer carbohydrates than usual: My only carbohydrate-heavy food of
    late has been potatoes. I haven't had wheat or rice recently.

  * More salt: I had a lot of tomato soup, which has a bit of salt
    mixed into it. While not significant at the quantities I used to
    have it previously, I did have a bunch more now. Salt should
    allegedly reduce heart rate and increase blood pressure, and I
    felt I had increased heart rate -- but I didn't actually measure
    my heart rate so it's possible I misunderstood the symptom
    directionally.

* Medications: The medications seem to be a likely culprit
  particularly for hitherto unseen symptoms. In particular:

  * Hydrocodone acetaminophen (note that hydrocodone is an opioid)
    seems to be implicated in bradycardia (slow heart rate) and
    perhaps also in tachycardia. Basically it does interfere with
    heart functioning. I initially thought I will stop taking this as
    I have not experienced any pain so far in the surgery site, but
    then I decided to continue taking it for now.

  * Ibuprofen has been implicated in heart issues, though not
    specifically in tachycardia. In fact, ibuprofen is expected to
    slow heart rate. I've decided to continue taking it for now.

  * Clindamycin has been implicated in tachycardia; see
    e.g. [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/clindamycin-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20110243)
    that lists "fast heartbeat". I feel inclined to stop it; however,
    the directions for the antibiotic suggest taking the full course
    if I start it. I've decided to continue taking it for now.

* Reduced exercise: I haven't exercised since Tuesday, though I did do
  a bunch of physical exertion on Tuesday and Wednesday. The lack of
  exercise might have affected my metabolism somewhat.

* Slightly less sleep than usual: I stayed up late on Wednesday and
  Thursday night, while still getting up not correspondingly late. I
  don't think this was extreme, but it's possible that it contributed
  a bit to symptoms.

* Sleeping only on my right side: This might have somehow affected the
  balance of my body. Subjectively, I felt much better this night
  after allowing myself to sleep on my left side.

## Dental self-care

### First saltwater rinse on 2023-07-06 around 3:30 PM

I did not brush, rinse, or floss for around 26 hours after the wisdom
tooth removal. I finally did a saltwater rinse on 2023-07-06 around
3:30 PM. This followed recommendations to not brush, rinse, or floss
for the first day after the wisdom tooth removal.

After the saltwater rinse, I also washed my glass, as I'd been
drinking water from it along with having a bunch of cool liquid foods,
and I wanted my future water-drinking to have a fresh feel.

### Regular saltwater rinse and flossing around 7:15 PM on 2023-07-06 after dinner

After finishing my dinner on 2023-07-06 between 6 PM and 7 PM, I
proceeded to do the usual post-dinner dental care, with slight tweaks.

I did my saltwater rinse first. I took care to not spit out forcefully
but just let the accumulated spit fall with gravity.

After that, I flossed my teeth using
the floss pick. However, I left out the area near the wisdom teeth and
the vicinity (about 2 of the surviving teeth each on the upper and
lower left side).

### First brushing of my teeth around 12:40 AM on 2023-07-07

On 2023-07-07 around 12:40 AM, about five hours after I had rinsed and
flossed, I brushed my teeth for the first time since the wisdom tooth
removal operation. The gap from the wisdom tooth removal to the first
brushing was about 35 hours.

I took care to not brush in the wisdom tooth area, and overall was a
little gentler with my strokes. I also tried to not spit out too
vigorously.

The only somewhat unusual thing was a small amount of dark stuff
included in my spit, which might have been some food/drink remains or
might have been a bit of dried blood. There was no sensation of
bleeding and overall no discomfort or pain during or immediately after
brushing.

### Second brushing of my teeth around 10:30 AM on 2023-07-07

On 2023-07-07, about an hour after waking up and before having any
food, I brushed my teeth. This was my second time brushing my teeth
since the operation. This time, I brushed a little bit closer to the
region operated on, but was still very gentle around the area.

### No further notes

Starting 2023-07-07 I plan to do regular brushing, flossing, and
rinsing, while still being gentle and careful near the removed wisdom
teeth. I won't record further notes.

## Communication challenges

I had difficulty talking while the gauze was still in my mouth, which
was the case for my three Walgreens trips on the afternoon of
2023-07-05. I used hand gestures, nodding and shaking, and brief
verbal statements to communicate my intent.
