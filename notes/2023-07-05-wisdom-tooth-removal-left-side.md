# 2023-07-05 wisdom tooth removal (left side)

This document describes the process of wisdom tooth removal for my
left side. For more general context on the wisdom tooth removal
procedure, see
[2023-wisdom-tooth-removal.md](2023-wisdom-tooth-removal.md).

## Arrival at office

I took BART from Ashby to 19th Street Oakland and then walked over to
the Rotunda Treatment Center, where I arrived around 12:25 PM. I then
filled in various intake forms and was done around 12:35 PM, after
which I sat down and waited. I kept my eyes closed and relaxed for
most of my waiting time though I did check email and Slack quickly. I
switched my phone to a Do Not Disturb mode at 12:50 PM.

## X-rays

I was called in at 1:01 PM by a female doctor for dental X-rays, which
I completed. After that, I went to the operation area and lay down on
the dentist's chair.

## Operation process

### Explanation

Soon, Dr. James Connors, the lead doctor for the surgery,
arrived. He confirmed that I'll be getting my left side teeth removed
and that I've opted in to laughing gas and local anesthesia.

He said I should expect a day of bleeding, a week of pain, and a month
of healing.

He also said that my teeth weren't impacted so this is expected to be
a straightforward process and should take under 10 minutes.

### Laughing gas

Dr. Connors and the female doctor who had taken my X-ray then
proceeded to fit the nasal mask on me for laughing gas
administration. They also put a little bit of gel on my lower and
upper left area of my gumline. They left me alone with it for a while.

The female doctor checked in after a few minutes and Dr. Connors
checked in again after about 5 minutes. Everything seemed fine.

### Local anesthesia

The doctors then injected the local anesthesia into the lower and
upper left area of my gumline. Again, they left me for a little while
after that for the anesthesia to take effect.

After they came back, they checked again how things were going. I
noticed some numbness in my right hand and foot, and I wasn't sure if
this is due to the laughing gas or the local anesthesia. Dr. Connors
suspected it's the laughing gas, and that it should subside after I'm
taken off of it.

### Actual removal

After they were confident that the local anesthesia had taken effect,
they topped it a little bit and then proceeded with the wisdom tooth
extraction.

To begin with, Dr. Connors gave me a mouth prop that he installed
between the teeth on my right side in order to prop my mouth wide
open, to make it easier for them to extract.

Then they began the extraction. I closed my eyes for the actual
procedure. I didn't experience pain in the dental area itself; the
main unpleasant sensation was the sensation of significant physical
force during the extraction process. The extractions themselves
happened quickly.

### Gauze application

After the removal, I was taken off of the laughing gas. The female
doctor applied gauze in the area and gave me post-operation
instructions as well as some additional gauze, a syringe, and a cold
pack. She also provided some verbal clarifications around the
instructions.

## Exit process

After I left the operating room, I sat down in the waiting area so I
could review the instructions to see if I had any further questions.

### Booking of followup appointment

I booked a followup appointment for Wednesday August 16 at 1 PM. The
followup appointment was somewhat cheaper as there was no need for the
X-ray step that had been completed in this appointment.

I also got confirmation that the additional medication had been sent
to the Walgreens (at Adeline Street) and checked that the office is
open till 4:40 PM in case there's some issue with the medication.

I finally exited the office around 1:54 PM.

## Walgreens trip

### Initial trip

I arrived at the Walgreens a little after 2:15 PM. The pharmacy was
temporarily closed, so I waited in line for it to open. When my turn
came, the person at the counter said that my order has been received
but has not yet been prepared because they're a little behind. He
asked me to come in an hour (around 3:30 PM).
