## August 22 symptoms

On Sunday, August 22, I experienced itchiness in my chest/neck area
and near my waist, as well as more minor itches elsewhere on my
body. For the most part I tried resisting the itch to scratch,
instead, rubbing, applying moisturizer, and water. I did, however, get
small red scratches. I covereed the biggest one of them with a
bandage.

At 7:30 PM I took a measurement and got a temperature of 100.0 degrees
Fahrenheit. Subsequent readings in the next hour gave 99.5, 99.6, and
99.3 degrees.

After taking a bath in net-lukewarm water, I re-measured my
temperature and got 98.2, which puts me out of fever territory. The
itches haven't healed so I need to continue to monitor for a little
longer.

## Possible culprits

* I had been doing a lot of house cleaning recently, and as part of
  that I cleaned out a nest and spider webs (th nest cleaning was on
  August 21). Dust and other stuff from the nest fell all over me, so
  I might have had a reaction to some of it. The chest/neck area in
  particular was more exposed than others.

* I met some people in the morning for house showing / move. We wore
  masks and maintained distancing. I don't think this was causal,
  though, because some of my symptoms had started a bit earlier.

## Pre-symptoms

The following were some early indicators that I did not pay a lot of attention to:

* When taking a bath on Saturday August 21 (after the nest cleaning) I
  had a preference for cold water much more than usual, suggesting
  that, without necessarily realizing it, I was a little bit hotter.

* In the morning I felt a bit hotter than usual but chalked it up to
  closing the window early in the morning.

## Followup overnight and next morning

I continued to feel somewhat itchy overnight on Sunday August 22 and
the morning of Monday August 23. I kept moisturizer handy so that I
could use it while in bed and could resist the urge to scratch.

My morning temperature readings came to 98.7 (at around 5:37 AM) and
98.4 (at around 6:57 AM).
