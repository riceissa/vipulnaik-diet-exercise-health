On Sunday, August 22, I experienced itchiness in my chest/neck area
and near my waist, as well as more minor itches elsewhere on my
body. For the most part I tried resisting the itch to scratch,
instead, rubbing, applying moisturizer, and water. I did, however, get
small red scratches. I covereed the biggest one of them with a
bandage.

At 7:30 PM I took a measurement and got a temperature of 100.0 degrees
Fahrenheit.

Possible culprits:

* I had been doing a lot of house cleaning recently, and as part of
  that I cleaned out a nest and spider webs. Dust and other stuff from
  the nest fell all over me, so I might have had a reaction to some of
  it. The chest/neck area in particular was more exposed than others.

* I met some people in the morning for house showing / move. We wore
  masks and maintained distancing. I don't think this was causal,
  though, because some of my symptoms had started a bit earlier.
