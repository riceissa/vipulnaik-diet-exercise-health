# Best practices after fast

This document includes some best practices to follow after a fast. I
define a "fast" as being 18 or more hours of not eating, or 10 or more
hours of not having my first meal after waking up, or 3 or more hours
of a combination of travel, standing activity, or being seated in the
sun without food and water since waking up. My body seems capable of
handling shorter durations without eating.

In general, the symptom I am trying to avoid is a sore throat,
specifically, a sore esophagus. Looking at the potential causes
[here](https://www.mynurz.co.id/en/article/blog-post-title-one-99frw-9wslr-7hwbc-zmxkc-7beza-9hz5d-2a6fc-zfg67-d5br7-m9hn6-my99z-7styn-jsbsk#:~:text=Sore%20throat.&text=In%20addition%2C%20during%20fasting%2C%20the,errors%20when%20breaking%20the%20fast.),
my guess is that this happens due to "stomach acid rising into the
esophagus" though it could also reflect one of the other causes.

* [2024-01-27: unplanned 22-hour fast](2024-01-27-unplanned-22-hour-fast.md) that was an exacerbating factor for the [2024-01 garlic-flavored olive oil and sore throat incident](2024-01-garlic-flavored-olive-oil-and-sore-throat.md)

## Hydrate before eating

Before breaking the fast, make sure to drink enough water, ideally
multiple times over the 30 minutes prior to eating. This is
particularly relevant if the fast was also accompanied by reduced
water intake, or if I was out in the sun where dehydration is
likely. Also, make sure to urinate in order to make space for drinking
water.

## Foods to avoid for the meals after a fast

* Spicy outside food: If possible, avoid spicy outside food, such as
  the Udupi Palace sambhar. Try to avoid for about a week after a fast
  or at least four days after last-experienced symptoms.

* Sauerkraut: This is very acidic and should be avoided for about 48
  hours after a fast or after last-experienced soreness. Go for vegan
  probiotic yogurt instead.

* Walnuts: The sharp edges of the nuts could irritate an already
  inflamed esophagus. Walnuts should be avoided for about 48 hours
  after a fast or after last-experienced soreness.

* Oil: I don't generally have standalone oil anyway, but this
  avoidance can be interpreted in terms of avoiding oil-rich portions
  of my food (for instance, an oily broth that might be in one of the
  storage containers whereas the others are heavier on the soft
  vegetables). This caution should be maintained for the first two
  meals after breaking the fast.

## Foods to have more of after a fast

* More liquid foods, such as almond milk, as these help with
  hydration.

* Miso and ginger broth

* Vegan probiotic yogurt
