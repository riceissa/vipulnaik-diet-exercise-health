In the last week or two till Sunday August 18, 2019, I've been having
a lot of extra turmeric. Specifically, I've been adding some turmeric
directly to meals; previously, I used to just have turmeric as part of
the cooked vegetables.

I've also had a somewhat uneven sleep cycle recently because of
staying up late for some deadlines, which may have been the main
contributor to my ill-health. I've also been having some personal
stress and generally feeling fatigued.

As of Saturday August 17, I was feeling a little bit dizzy, and I feel
this was due to the turmeric. However, the general ill-health was
likely due to the stress.

I cleared my bowels thrice between Saturday night and Sunday morning:

* Saturday night around 9 PM
* Sunday around 4:30 AM
* Sunday around 7:30 AM

After the third of these, I was feeling quite light in my stomach, and
more healthy again, though still a little bit fatigued.
