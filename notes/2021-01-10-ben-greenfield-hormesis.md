Ben Greenfield is a biohacking / living healthy expert. In early January 2021, I watched two videos of his, both interviews by Tom Bilyeu:

My crude guess is that maybe 70% of what he says works, 20% doesn't
have much effect, and 10% maybe does the opposite of work ... as with
most such things it's hard to know exactly what works. Probably the
couple of things in what he said that were immediately actionable to
me (though not completely new) were based on the idea of hormesis:

1. Splash cold water on your face and upper body periodically to wake
   your body up: He suggested taking cold showers, but splashing cold
   water is faster and easier to consistently stick to.

2. After exercising,, wait some time before eating: I made this change
   immediately. I used to eat within 5-10 minutes of returning from my
   morning jog; I now wait 30 minutes.
