# 2023-07-03: acetaminophen consumption

I decided to give a try to consuming acetaminophen on the evening of
2023-07-03. Acetaminophen is a pain medication; it's the active
ingredient of Tylenol, but I ended up buying the Walgreens
acetaminophen brand.

## Pain prior to having acetaminophen

I did not have acetaminophen for pain relief; I had it to check that I
don't have any obvious adverse reaction to acetaminophen. However,
earlier in the day, I incidentally was experiencing slight aches in my
leg, specifically the bottom of my left leg and my left knee. This is
likely related to heavy exertion and exercise in the last few
days. The pain was receding in any case, so any further reduction in
the pain is unlikely to have acetaminophen as its root cause.

## Temperature readings prior to having acetaminophen

My temperature readings prior to consuming acteminophen were in the
range of 97.9 to 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Time of consumption

I had one capsule (500 mg) at 9:20 PM at night on 2023-07-03.
