# Health profile

Last major update: October 27, 2023

Last pass of full document review (with updates and corrections where needed): March 12, 2024

This is the health profile for Vipul Naik. It is updated
periodically. It does not include details of specific
events/incidents; these are generally recorded in their own respective
files. Links to the most recent and/or relevant incidents are included
here.

When updating this document:

* Make sure to update the links to the last dental appointment and the
  last eye exam.
* Make sure to update the HbA1c and lipid profile section to reflect
  the latest test results.
* Update all occurrences of "as of `<year>`" to the correct year,
  after verifying that the assertion still holds.
* Go through the whole document to see if anything else needs updating.

## Vital signs

### Heart rate

My resting, seated heart rate, as measured by my Zacurate pulse
oximeter, is generally 55-60 bpm. At any given time, the heart rate
variation is about 10%, or 5 bpm. So sometimes my heart rate may be
65-70 bpm, sometimes 60-65 bpm, and sometimes 50-55 bpm.

My heart rate goes up by about 10-15 bpm when I stand up, and then
stabilizes down to about 5 bpm higher than my seated heart rate.

My heart rate is a little lower in the morning (measured after a bowel
movement), and the variation may also be more. On some mornings, I
have measured a heart rate of 44-55 bpm.

Generally, when my resting heart rate exceeds 75 bpm, I can "feel" my
heart racing. After I took antibiotics as part of my recovery process
from the [2023-07-05 wisdom tooth removal (left
side)](2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md), there were
periods where I could feel my heart racing. I didn't have the pulse
oximeter at the time, so I relied on crude measurement of my heart
rate, and the crude estimate was around 80 bpm.

For more extensive experiment results, see
[2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md](2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md).

### SpO2 (saturation percentage of oxygen)

My SpO2 is about 97% most of the time (sometimes going up to 98% and
sometimes going down to 96%). It is a little higher in the mornings
(around 99%). It can drop to as low as 92% when I do an extended
breath hold, but it quickly rebounds and even overshoots before
settling back to its equilibrium value.

For more extensive experiment results, see
[2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md](2023-08-18-pulse-oximeter-experimentation.md).

### Temperature

My temperature, as measured by a non-contact forehead infrared
thermometer, ranges from 97.6 to 99. Temperatures at the high end of
this range, when I am feeling well, are generally due to high ambient
temperatures for an extended period of time. See
[2021-08-temperature-baseline.md](2021-08-temperature-baseline.md) for
a historical established temperature baseline.

### Blood pressure

I do not have a blood pressure machine at home, so I only get readings
when I go for medical appointments. My two most recent readings were
108 / 78 on 2023-10-04 (as part of the [2023-10-04 eye
exam](2023-10-04-eye-exam.md)) and 102 / 67 on 2021-10-29 (as part of
the [2021-10-29 eye exam](2021-10-29-eye-exam.md)). These readings are
consistent with my expectations.

## Physical build

### Height

My height is a tad over 5 feet 9 inches. This puts me a little below
average height for an adult male.

### Weight

My weight is between 56 kg and 58 kg, or between 123 lb and 128
lb. According to online BMI calculators, this puts me at a BMI at the
low end of the normal category, just a little above the underweight
threashold.

My weight used to be about 120 lb or 54 kg around 2017, and appears to
have gradually increased over the years, likely partly related to an
increase in muscle mass.

### Waist size

I have a lean, athletic appearance. My waist size is at the "small"
end, with shorts/trousers sizes of 28 and 30 generally working for me,
and 32 being manageable with a tight belt. I do not have a paunch.

## Dental status

* I generally get dental checkups and cleaning done every 6-7
  months. As of 2023, my dental care is handled by Total Health Dental
  Care, and I go to the branch at 3017 Telegraph Avenue. The notes for
  the most recent appointment should reflect the current status of my
  dental health. Look in my notes folder for files with the word
  `dental-cleaning` in them to locate the most recent appointment. As
  of the last major edit of this document,
  [this](2023-09-27-dental-cleaning.md) is my most recent appointment.

* All four of my wisdom teeth have been removed. The removal was done
  in 2023: [overall doc](2023-wisdom-tooth-removal.md), [left
  side](2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md), and [right
  side](2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md).

* I got periodontal therapy in September / October 2021, i.e., I had a
  below-the-gumline deep cleaning done. For more details, see [first
  appointment](2021-09-29-periodontal-therapy-first-appointment.md),
  [second
  appointment](2021-10-06-periodontal-therapy-second-appointment.md),
  and [followup
  appointment](2021-12-15-periodontal-therapy-followup-appointment.md).

* My [December 2018 document on a bunch of related
  pains](2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md) that I experienced,
  including dental pain, and that also marked the start of my
  photosensitivity, may be worth reading.

## Eye status

* I get eye exams every 1-2 years. As of 2023, I get my eye exams from
  UC Berkeley Optometry. Look in the notes folder for files with
  `eye-exam` in them to locate information on my eye exams. The most
  recent one is generally the one to pay attention to. As of the last
  major edit of this document, [this](2023-10-04-eye-exam.md) is my
  most recent eye exam.

* I have some issues with distance vision, as evinced in the eye exam
  results. Since I don't drive, and the issues haven't gotten in my
  way so far, I have not chosen to get corrective lenses for these
  issues.

* Other things surfaced by my eye exam: (benevolent so far) melanosis,
  and a difference in the inner/outer ratio between my left and right
  eye (seen through fundus photos). To monitor for trends in either
  eye, I get fundus photos taken with each eye exam (this costs an
  extra $20).

* I have a mild form of photosensitivity, whereby being in sunlight or
  indoor lighting for an extended period of time (generally over an
  hour) can cause me to get fatigued. I have adjusted to this by
  getting sunglasses for outdoor trips, using dark mode and low-light
  settings for my electronics use, and keeping the lights off in the
  evening / at night most of the time. The photosensitivity started
  along with my [Decemer 2018 head/neck/jaw/tooth
  pain](2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md).

## Physical exam

As of 2023, my last physical exam was in December 2016, when I went to
a gastro specialist for my stomach pain issues. See
[here](2016-11-to-2016-12-stomach-pain-and-resolution.md#doctor-visit)
for more context.

Since then, I have not had any physical exams beyond blood pressure
measurement done as part of my eye exam.

## HbA1c, lipid profile, insulin, and liver function tests

One of the sets of metrics I get tested every few years is my lipid
profile and HbA1c. This is due to a family history of diabetes and
other complications. For the full list of readings, see
[test_results.sql](../sql/test_results.sql).

### HbA1c

The HbA1c is a percentage, though the percentage sign is usually
omitted from the readings. 6.5 and higher is considered diabetic, 5.7
to 6.4 is considered prediabetic, and 4 to 5.6 is considered normal.

My HbA1c has never been measured in the prediabetic range. In December
2016, when I was having stomach issues, and in general had a
relatively unhealthy diet with more consumption of hot chocolate (a
sugary drink) and outside food, my HbA1c was at 5.5, a little below
the prediabetic range.

However, my more recent reading as of June 2021 gives a HbA1c of 5.0,
which is far enough away from the prediabetic range. This likely
reflects improvements to diet (no sugary drinks, and less outside
food).

### Lipid profile

I've taken lipid profile measurements starting April 2004, with my
most recent measurement being in June 2021 as part of my [2021 blood
test plans](2021-blood-test-plans.md).

Overall, my most recent lipid profile (as of 2021) is close enough to
normal, but this is something I need to continue monitoring given
family diabetic tendencies.

#### Cholesterol total (acceptable range: 0-200 mg/dL)

My cholesterol total has always stayed within range. Overall, it
appears to have been increasing somewhat from ~150 in 2004 to being
only slightly below the upper limit of 200 in the last test in 2021.

It will be interesting to see how my cholesterol evolves as of the
next measurement. I've made a number of improvements to diet and
lifestyle since the previous measurement.

#### Cholesterol HDL direct (acceptable range: 30-60 mg/dL)

My first cholesterol HDL direct reading, done 2004, showed a result of
28, below the acceptable range. Since then, my HDL has been generally
increasing. The last two readings (2017 and 2021) were 51 and 46
respectively, which are well within the range and specifically, in the
upper half of the range.

#### Cholesterol LDL (acceptable range: 0-100 mg/dL)

My LDL measurements have always hovered around the threshold, with the
very first reading in April 2004 being 99, just below the threshold of
100. My last two measurements, in November 2017 and June 2021, have
both come out above 100, at 109.7 and 122 respectively.

#### Cholesterol VLDL (acceptable range: 0-35 mg/dL)

My VLDL measurements have generally been within the acceptable range,
though there were two outlier measurements, in 2005 and 2007
respectively, both from the same lab. My November 2017 measurement of
15.8 was safely within the limit.

The June 2021 tests do not include any measurement of VLDL. According
to [this page](https://medlineplus.gov/vldlcholesterol.html), VLDL
*can't* be directly measured, and it is extrapolated based on serum
triglycerides by taking 1/5 of the value of serum
triglycerides. Empirically, it does look like the reported test
results since September 2005 have followed the 1/5 formula, so if we
applied the same formula to the June 2021 test results, then the VLDL
would work out to 24.8, which would be within the normal range.

#### Serum triglycerides (acceptable range: 0-150 mg/dL)

Using the 1/5 mapping of cholesterol VLDL and serum triglycerides, it
seems that the threshold on triglycerides is a little stricter than on
VLDL. Some of my older readings were above the threshold, but my most
recent readings have been within the threshold, with the two recent
readings being 79 (November 2017) and 124 (June 2021).

#### Triglyceride:HDL ratio

Although my blood tests don't directly report this ratio, I've seen a
bunch of online guidance suggesting that the ratio of triglycerides to
HDL is more predictive of problems than the ratio of LDL to HDL.

In my November 2017 test, I got a triglyceride:HDL ratio of 79/51
which is a little over 1.5, which is at the boundary of the healthy
range of 1.5 and below.

My June 2021 test was not that great, with a triglyceride:HDL ratio of
124/46 which is at 2.7, a little above 2.5. Above 2.5 is considered
cause for concern. With that said, it's just one reading, and I really
need a wider range of readings to get a clearer picture.

### Insulin

I have gotten tested for insulin only once, in June 2021. The reading
came to 3.6, compared to a reference range of 0 to 19.6. Generally,
lower is better. 6 and below is considered fairly healthy, so my
reading is at a fairly healthy level.

### Liver function tests

I've gotten liver function tests done in June 2005 and December
2016. In June 2005, I got bilirubin, ALT, and AST. Bilirubin came
above normal; ALT and AST came within the normal range, but for ALT in
particular, the reading of 28 was above what I now understand to be
the desired upper limit of 25.

In December 2016, I only got ALT and AST (no bilirubin). Both readings
came fairly healthy; the ALT reading in particular was just 11, well
within the desired upper limit of 25.

## Infectious diseases and vaccines

See [vaccine_administrations.sql](../sql/vaccine_administrations.sql)
for a full list of vaccine administrations. For some vaccine
administrations, I also have an individual notes file about the
vaccine administration; the notes file is linked from the notes column
of the SQL.

### COVID-19

I have never been diagnosed with COVID-19, and am fairly confident
that I have not been infected with COVID-19.

I tested myself once (on 2022-04-06) for COVID-19 using at at-home
test, when I was having a fever. I tested negative. The fever was
likely an aftereffect of an injury. See
[here](2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md#covid-19-antigent-test)
for details.

I got my primary COVID-19 vaccine series from Pfizer in 2021 (in May
2021 and [June
2021](2021-06-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-dose-2.md)). Since then, I have
been getting a booster every year, with the booster some time between
November and January. As of the writing of this document, my most
recent vaccine was on [January 12,
2024](2024-01-12-pfizer-covid-vaccine-updated-booster-dose.md).

Starting with my second COVID-19 dose and then for each booster dose
(though much less pronounced for the January 2024 dose), I
have reacted with a slight fever; the fever has generally subsided
within 36 hours of getting the dose. With successive boosters, both
the onset of the fever and its resolution have tended to get faster.

### Influenza (flu)

I'm reasonably confident that I have not had the flu or any other
influenza-like illness (ILI) since 2014.

I have been getting annual flu shots since around 2010 (though I might
have missed a year or two in between). I generally get the flu shot
some time between September and December each year.

I have records of the date of vaccination starting 2015; this
information is available in
[vaccine_administrations.sql](../sql/vaccine_administrations.sql). My
most recent administration was in [October
2023](2023-10-13-flu-shot.md).

In general, I have not had significant reactions to the flu shot. The
main symptom has been slight soreness in the area of administration
for the next day. For my [October 2023 flu
shot](2023-10-13-flu-shot.md), the soreness continued in a relatively
mild form for about a week, and might have been causal in some
stiffness in the neck and shoulder as well. I believe this was due to
an interaction with hand gripper exercises, that I [started doing in
July 2023](2023-07-29-hand-gripper-exercise.md).

### Childhood vaccines

I got the standard set of vaccines as a young child in India. Prior to
moving to the United States for graduate study, I reviewed my vaccine
history and got a few additional vaccines to be compliant with the
requirements (including possibly vaccines that I had already gotten as
a child but didn't have a record of). Details of my childhood vaccines
have not yet been updated online, but physical copies of these are
available, and I'm planning to digitize the information.

### Common cold and sore throat / running nose

I have had occasional cases of sore throat / running nose, that I
believe might be due to the common cold or other causes, such as
dietary irritants. In all the cases, I suspect dietary irritants
rather than respiratory cold viruses as the cause, but I might be
wrong in some of the cases.

* [2023-08-04 sore throat suspected to be due to sauerkraut and red
  chutney
  consumption](2023-08-04-sauerkraut-red-chutney-and-sore-throat.md):
  This was during my recovery period from my [2023-07-05 wisdom tooth
  removal (left side)](2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md),
  and was likely due to aftereffects of the wisdom tooth removal
  itself or my body's adverse reaction to the preventative antibiotic
  (clindamycin) that I took after the procedure.

* [2021-08-28 sore throat after
  meals](2021-08-28-sore-throat-after-meals.md): Just a sore throat,
  no runny nose; I addressed this with some remedial measures.

* [2021-02-27 sauerkraut and sore
  throat](2021-02-27-sauerkraut-and-sore-throat.md): Just a sore
  throat, no runny nose; I addressed this by briefly taking a break
  from sauerkraut.

* [2019-08-30 Thai yellow curry and subsequent
  cold](2019-08-30-thai-yellow-curry-and-subsequent-cold.md): After
  having a huge amount of Thai yellow cury, I had a runny nose. The
  runny nose recovered quickly. I believe it was throat irritation and
  not a viral cold, but I'm not sure.

Overall, my incidence of runny nose has been very low since I moved to
Berkeley in 2014; the above incident list is likely comprehensive
starting 2019, and there may have been equivalent/similar incidents at
a similar frequency going back to 2014.

From 2007 to 2013 I was in Chicago and got clear-cut cases of the
common cold (not attributable to anything dietary) once every 1-2
years.

In my childhood, I used to get common colds quite often (perhaps even
more frequently than my peers).

### Other cases of fever (excluding after vaccines)

* [2022-04-05 fall and phone screen
  crack](2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md): I had a brief
  fever after the injury; slight fever after injuries is expected.

* [2021-08-22 fever and rash](2021-08-22-fever-and-rash.md): I had a
  brief fever and rash the day after I cleaned out a nest and had a
  bunch of stuff fall on me during the cleaning process.

* [2020-07-28 fever
  episode](2020-coronavirus-activity-tracker#tuesday-july-28) that
  resolved after a long night's sleep.

### Childhood diseases

#### Chickenpox

I got chickenpox when I was around 4 or 5.

#### Ear infection

I got an ear infection before the age of 4, due to which I lost about
60% of my hearing. Fortunately, the infection was detected quickly and
I was operated on and recovered my hearing.

## Injuries

See [accidents.sql](../sql/accidents.sql) that includes accidents that
injured me or damaged my stuff. The most significant injuries since
2014 that affected me bodily are listed below:

* [2022-04-05 fall and phone screen
  crack](2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md): This was a
  running fall accompanied by a phone screen crack.

* [2019-09-10 traffic accident](2019-09-10-traffic-accident.md): I was
  hit by a car at a stop sign (traveling very slowly).

* 2014-12-15 running fall: This was a major running fall, that
  prompted me to get a Tdap vaccine and sit with my knees spread out
  for a few days.

## Lifestyle

### Largely sedentary lifestyle with deliberate exercise

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, I have
predominantly worked from home. Outside of daily jogging, I don't have
daily outside-the-house trips. Beyond that, I do outside trips for
grocery shopping, picking up takeout food, toiletry shopping, and some
other chores.

### Mostly computer-based day

While at home, I spend most of the day on the computer, both when
working and for most of my personal tasks. Even when eating and for
the cutting portions of meal prep, particularly the cutting of
vegetables, I am in front of a computer (usually watching a movie, TV
show, or other video, sometimes reading material). When doing at-home
strength exercises, I sometimes have a podcast on.

The above has been approximately true for several years, but it's been
becoming more true since the switch to work-from-home and the increase
in the extent to which things can be handled online.

### Walking for most outside trips

For most outside trips, I walk both ways. I use mass transit (usually
Bay Area Rapid Transit, occasionally a bus) once every few months,
generally only when the location I'm going to is more than 45 minutes
away walking, and sometimes when walking is difficult due to weather
conditions. I don't have a car and almost never use taxi or rideshare
services.

I used BART a lot more prior to the switch to work-from-home in March
2020, and since I was using BART more in general to commute to work
(that was quite far from my home) I was used to using it even for
somewhat shorter trips. So the switch to work-from-home has really
helped change the way I use and think about BART.

The switch to part-time work in March 2023 has led me to switch
further in the direction of walking. Specifically, it's changed the
distance threshold at which I decide to use BART instead of
walking. When time was scarcer, I would tend to use BART at distances
of 30 minutes or more; now the threshold is about 45 minutes and in
some cases even higher. In particular, in practice pretty much
anything that can be done in Berkeley or in areas bordering Berkeley
(such as North Oakland or Emeryville) I would do by walking.

### Low-stress job

Since my job is part-time, and the systems I am working on are mostly
stable, there are rarely time-sensitive urgent things to handle, and
the total amount of work is relatively easy to manage. Overall, I
would describe my job as low-stress.

This is a relatively recent development. The period from 2018 to 2020
was a period of relatively high stress at the job. Starting 2021, my
workload-related stress has been reducing. There was an increase in
some aspects of stress after a job switch, but this was not so much
due to "too much work" and more due to challenges related to the
nature of the work. After my return to my old job in March 2023, and
the switch to part-time, I haven't had any job-related stress. There
have been brief bursts of working hard, but these have been mostly
optional and a choice I made to get ahead on some fronts.

Aspects that help keep things low-stress:

* Part-time nature of job
* Relative absence of urgent / time-sensitive tasks
* Familiarity with the systems I'm working with (developed over
  several years)
* Good interpersonal relations at the job and lack of conflict
* Work-from-home with fairly flexible hours (so commuting time is low,
  I have flexibility regarding when I wake up, and I have enough
  flexibility that I rarely have to worry about missing exercise for
  the whole day because something came up in the morning)
* Low meeting load and no strict requirement to turn the camera on
  during meetings

### Low pollution

Typically, the air quality index (AQI) in Berkeley is between 20 and
35. This is considered good. Subjectively, I rarely feel like I'm in
polluted settings.

Air quality can sometimes get bad due to smoke from forest fires
farther away. In such cases, I can take additional precautions such as
taking a break from outdoor trips, closing windows, and masking up if
I do need to go outdoors. See [2023-09-19 onward air quality
issues](2023-09-19-onward-air-quality-issues.md) for an example of
such an incident.

### No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs

#### Smoking

I have never smoked or used other nicotine-based products.

I have not been exposed to any significant amount of secondhand or
thirdhand smoke. I haven't been indoors with somebody smoking for the
past several years as of 2023, and have only briefly passed by or
trailed people smoking outdoors occasionally.

#### Alcohol

I do not consume any alcoholic beverages, and have never consumed
alcoholic beverages in a significant amount. I have sipped small
amounts of alcoholic beverages to get a sense of how they taste and
smell.

Cough syrup that I consumed (and mostly didn't like) as a child did
contain a nontrivial amount of alcohol.

#### Recreational drugs

I have not personally tried, or been in a closed room with other
people trying, recreational drugs.

## Diet

See https://vipulnaik.com/diet/ for a page with more details on
specific foodstuffs and places I eat or used to eat at, with a focus
on dietary developments from 2014 to 2023.

### Childhood diet

As a child, I followed a vegetarian diet, primarily as a
result of growing up in a vegetarian household in India.

On the vegatarian/vegan distinction:

* Milk and milk products: I had milk products regularly; most significantly,
  curd/yogurt. I also had other milk products to varying degrees,
  including milk, cheese, cottage cheese (paneer), though toward my
  teen years I had phased many of these out.

* Eggs: I remember having egg-based products (omelets, egg-based
  cakes) a few times as a child, but these were not part of my regular
  diet.

* Honey: I remember having honey (jams, marmalades) occasionally, but
  this was not a regular part of my diet.

Due to a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and heart problems,
I was conscious from a relatively young age of the importance of
reducing the intake of sugar and fried foods, and of keeping
carbohydrate consumption to a modicum.

### Changes to diet

As an adult, I have mostly continued with my childhood diet, with
minor modifications. For a period of time in between, I used to
consume hot chocolate drinks daily (from Starbucks or similar
places). Although I didn't consume them for the sugar content, they
did have higher sugar content than the rest of my diet. In 2019, after
[encountering dental problems](2018-12-head-neck-jaw-tooth-pain.md)
that were partly related to this consumption, I phased out hot
chocolate consumption by May 2019. Since then, I have had very low
consumption of sugary foods.

At some point around 2018/2019, I transitioned from a vegetarian to a
vegan diet, mostly for ethical reasons, but also believing that there
would not be significant adverse health impacts. By this point, I was
already taking Vitamin D supplements, and I introduced sauerkraut into
my diet to make up for the loss of active cultures from stopping the
consumption of yogurt.

### Current diet

You can get a general sense of my current diet by looking at my
[recent food purchases](../sql/food_purchases.sql). I don't keep a log
of food consumption, but since I waste very little of my food, my food
purchases present a reasonably accurate picture of my food
consumption.

Here are some highlights of my current diet:

* It is vegan in the sense that none of the food I *regularly* consume
  uses animal products. However, I am not particular about vegan
  certification per se. On occasion, when eating out, I may have
  something milk-based, such as a *raita*, if it comes as part of a
  dish I otherwise want to have.

* I occasionally do shallow nutrient reviews such as the one in
  [2021-04-11](2021-04-11-shallow-nutrient-review.md), and may make
  diet adjustments based on that.

* The proportion of my food I eat that is restaurant takeout or
  equivalent (prepped meals) is, as of 2023, about 10-15%. Most of
  these are Udupi Palace spinach masala dosa. The general trend from
  2015/2016 to 2023 has been for this proportion to drop, with the
  drop being particularly sharp around 2023 after I reduced my work
  hours and consequently had more time for meal prep at home. At its
  peak, something like 25-35% of my meals may have been restaurant
  meals or prepped meals.

* Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I've basically
  stopped eating out except for cases where I'm meeting others; I
  instead do takeout. I have continued this practice and expect to
  continue it indefinitely, as it has several benefits.

* There's also a trend within my supermarket consumption for the food
  to move away from pre-packed meals to home-prepped meals. For
  instance, I used to get pre-cooked chana masala, vegetable biryani,
  and misal curry from Trader Joe's, but by early 2022, I had stopped
  getting all of these. This was to the point that I haven't needed a
  microwave oven at all since 2022.

* As of 2023, I have basically zero sugar-heavy foods or drinks.

* I have two meals a day on a typical day. My first meal is generally
  after my morning exercise (with a suitable waiting period in between
  where feasible) and my second meal is in the evening. There is no
  planned-for difference between the meals: both meals are of
  approximately similar size and use the same foods in a similar mix.

## Supplements

You can get my supplement consumption history from
[here](../sql/supplements.sql). This may not go back all the way to
when I started consuming the supplements, but it should be reasonably
comprehensive 2020 onward.

For blood test results that include results for the quantity of the
materials supplemented, see
[here](https://github.com/vipulnaik/diet-exercise-health/blob/master/sql/test_results.sql).

### November 2017: start of supplementation with Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and calcium/magnesium/zinc

I started this supplementation after my November 2017 India visit
where I learned more about my family health history and got my vitamin
levels tested to identify my deficiency. I subsequently switched to
brands that were locally available.

### December 2019: start of omega-3 supplementation

See [here](2019-12-30-decision-to-start-taking-omega-3-supplements.md)
for details of my decision process.

### July 2021: switch to Doctor's Best for Vitamin D supplementation

In July 2021, shortly after my [2021 blood test that confirmed my
continued good Vitamin D levels](2021-blood-test-plans.md), I switched
to a vegan 2500 IU Vitamin D3 supplement from Doctor's Best. I had
previously used the 2000 IU supplement from Finest Nutrition.

### Current supplements

My current supplement regime as of 2023 is:

* 1 daily 2500 IU vegan Vitamin D3 from Doctor's Best
  * My measured Vitamin D level is solidly in the normal range, but
    since my vegan diet has no Vitamin D3 (except a bit of
    fortification in my almond milk), continuing with the
    supplementation is the safe choice for now.

* 1 daily vegan omega-3 from Freshfield
  * As of the most recent measurement (2021) my omega-3 was still a
    bit on the low end, so I'm continuing with the supplementation,
    while also trying to get omega-3 from the diet as much as possible
    (spinach and walnuts)

* 1 daily Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc from Nature Made
  * This is just as a safety measure; I don't think I am deficient in
    any of these but it's good to top them up given my vegan diet.

* 1 daily Vitamin B12 (supplier can change over time)
  * I am not currently deficient in Vitamin B12 (the last test in 2018
    showed I was at the high end) but given my vegan diet, it's better
    to keep taking the supplement. Vitamin B12 is water-soluble so
    excess should flow out.

* Occasional Vitamin C supplement
  * I generally take this before or after events where I expect to be
    more exposed to infection; I don't think I am deficient in Vitamin
    C at all, but since it's water-soluble, excess can easily flow
    out.

With the exception of the occasional Vitamin C supplement, I have all
of these with my first meal of the day.

### Other one-off supplement consumption

Across late 2019, 2020, and 2021, I consumed a curcumin supplement
from a left-over bottle given by a friend to deal with occasional
inflammation issues (that happened once every few months). I used up
the bottle in August 2021 in its expiration month while addressing the
[2021-08-28 sore throat after
meals](2021-08-28-sore-throat-after-meals.md). I haven't bought
anything similar since then, since I haven't had similar inflammation
issues.

## Exercise

I do running/jogging almost-daily, strength exercises about 3 times a
week, and various balance/flexibility exercises several times a week
(between 3 and 7 times a week). I also do hand gripper exercises
daily.

I describe my exercise routine in more detail in
[exercise-routine.md](exercise-routine.md).

### History of exercise

Daily jogging has been something I have tried to maintain throughout
my adult life, and I did something similar even as teen. My ability to
adhere to that goal has fluctuated based on weather conditions and
time commitments.

The switch to working-from-home in March 2020 (with the COVID-19
pandemic) helped me be more regular with daily jogging, as there was
less need to get ready at a specific time to commute. After an
[injury](2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md) and subsequently
after moving my residence in April 2022, I increased the length and
consistency of my daily jogging distance, and also reduced my peak
jogging speed.

I hadn't done weights or strength training as a regular part of my
routine as an adult until November 2021. I introduced it in November
2021 after purchasing dumb bells and an exercise mat. See
[here](2021-11-02-weight-lifting-and-stretching.md) for details of my
initial progession. This was also around the time that I introduced
pushups; I had introduced some balance exercises a little earlier.

I started hand gripper exercises in July 2023; see
[here](2023-07-29-hand-gripper-exercise.md) for the initial
progression.

## Sleep

I go to sleep some time between 10:30 PM and 12:30 AM, depending on
how my work winds down as well as weather-related factors. I
occasionally go to sleep earlier (as early as 9:30 PM) or later (as
late as 3 AM).

While I do set an alarm to make sure I wake up in time for any
meetings or deliverables, my general goal is to wake up *before* the
alarm and to preemptively silence the alarm. On most days, I do
achieve this goal. My waking time can vary widely from 7 AM to 9 AM;
it depends a lot on when I go to sleep, whether I have a sleep backlog
from previous days, and the weather (I generally sleep in a bit more
if it's colder).

My average sleep duration is a little under 8 hours.

I generally don't remember dreams when I wake up, but I sometimes do
have dreams that I remember.

### Historical sleep issues

In the early 2010s, I had issues with falling asleep, and experimented
with taking melatonin a few times to improve my sleep quality. I did
not find clear improvement (but did not test extensively enough to get
conclusive information). In any case, my sleep issues resolved
themselves over time. As of 2023, I don't have any ongoing sleep
issues (such as difficulty falling asleep, highly restless sleep,
etc.)
 
## Other routine elements

### Bowel movements

I have daily morning bowel movements. Generally, after I wake up and
urinate, I spend about 10-15 minutes on the computer catching up on my
morning checklist, allowing the pressure to build up, then I have a
bowel movement.

### Dental routine

* Brushing: Once in the morning, and once about 1-6 hours after each
  meal (earlier if I need to go out after the meal so I can't wait the
  1-6 hours). Total 3 times per day. I use a soft (manual, not
  electric) toothbrush and change it every 3 months.

* Saltwater rinse: Once after post-meal cleanup for each meal. Total 2
  times per day.

* Flossing with interdental brush: Once after post-meal cleanup for
  first meal of the day, before saltwater rinse. Total once per day. I
  use a given interdental brush for about 3 days.

* Flossing with pick on floss holder: Once after post-meal cleanup for
  second meal of the day, after saltwater rinse. Total once per day.

## Medications

I do not take any ongoing medications (except supplements; see
[supplements](#supplements)).

### Pain medication in stock

I keep in stock not-yet-expired:

* acetaminophen/paracetamol (the active ingredient in tylenol, though
  I don't necessary use the tylenol brand)
* ibuprofen

Though I keep pain medication in stock, I don't generally consume it,
and in most cases, I have to throw it after it expires.

### Past medication consumption

* [2023-08-23 wisdom tooth removal (right
  side)](2023-08-23-wisdom-tooth-removal-right-side.md#consumption-of-medications):
  I consumed a few doses of pain medication, specifically 1 dose of
  hydrocodone / acetaminophen and 2 doses of ibuprofen. This was much
  less than the prescribed amount, but taking the pain medication was
  optional. I did not want to take too much pain medication because in
  my experience, taking too much pain medication can also end up
  masking my fatigue and get in the way of me being able to process my
  body's signals.

* [2023-07-05 wisdom tooth removal (left
  side)](2023-07-05-wisdom-tooth-removal-left-side.md#consumption-of-medications):
  I consumed 6 doses each of the antibiotic clindamycin, hydrocodone /
  acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. I had severe side-effects, likely from
  the consumption of the antibiotic. More details are in later
  sections of the linked doc.

* 2023-07-03: I took a test dose of acetaminophen in preparation for
  possibly needing to take it after my wisdom tooth removal. See
  [2023-07-03-acetaminophen-consumption.md](2023-07-03-acetaminophen-consumption.md)
  for more details.

I do not recall taking any non-supplement medication other than these
since 2018; I also don't recall taking non-supplement medication since
2014, though I might have taken some prior to 2018 that I don't
recall.

## Surgeries

### No surgeries other than dental procedures as an adult

As an adult (at least since I've turned 18) I haven't had any
surgeries, unless you count the wisdom tooth removal procedure
documented in my [dental status](#dental-status). For the wisdom tooth
removal procedure in 2023, as well as periodontal therapy in 2021, I
was administered local anesthetic. For the wisdom tooth removal, I was
also administered laughing gas. Other than these two procedures, I
have not received local anesthetic or laughing gas as an adult. I have
not been any sedation as an adult.

### Ear infection surgery as a child

When I was around 4 years old, I had surgery for my ear infection,
conducted by an ENT specialist.

### Wart removal as an older child

I had a wart above my upper lip as a child (I'm not sure exactly what
age). I had two attempted wart removal procedures, with the second one
being successful.

## Skin

My skin is on the dry side of the spectrum, so particularly in colder
climates, it can get cuts if not adequately cared for. I generally
apply vaseline lotion to my hands and legs daily, and may do
additional rounds of application during cold weather. With moderate
care, I don't have any noticeable skin issues.
