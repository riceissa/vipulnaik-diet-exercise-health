# 2023-10-13 flu shot

## Appointment booking

I booked my appointment for the flu shot on the afternoon of Friday
September 15. The appointment is for Friday October 13 at 3 PM at the
2801 Adeline Street location.

Some thoughts regarding the choice of date/time:

* Date/time: I wanted to pick a date/time where I'm not usually
  working, and where the next few days would also be light in terms of
  work and other external obligations. Friday 3 PM seems to be a good
  fit for these constraints.

* Time period: I wanted to get the flu shot out of the way, so that it
  does not interfere or conflict with other health-related things that
  I might want to time more precisely (for instance, I want to time my
  COVID-19 vaccine to abour 30-45 days prior to any travel I might
  undertake). However, I also wanted to make sure it's sufficiently
  late that my immunity is expected to last till the end of the flu
  season. Mid-October seems like the right time period for this
  tradeoff, so I picked the latest available date for which I could
  book an appointment.

After booking the appointment, I got a confirmation message. The
confirmation message says that I should report to the pharmacy 15
minutes prior to the appointment and that I should carry my insurance
card with me.

I also finished filling the consent form and other questions on the
website, so in principle I shouldn't need to fill them in on-site,
though judging from experience with past flu shots, I'll probably have
to fill the information again on-site.
