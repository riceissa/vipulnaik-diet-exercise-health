# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This continues with the spirit of my [2021 activity
tracker](2021-activity-tracker.md), recording my trips outside the
home. I exclude trips for jogging and running. I also exclude trips
for grocery purchases and picking up takeout from restaurants; you can
get a sense for those trips by looking in

walked back instead of taking the BART. I got back home around 3:41
PM.

## Tuesday March 29

In the evening I went to the Ashby area to check out a place to
rent. I took BART both ways.

## Tuesday April 5

In the morning, I fell when running, resulting in a phone screen crack
(see [here](2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md)).

#### Morning

To remedy this, I left home around 11 AM and went to the repair shop
at 1008 University Avenue. The technician there was on vacation, so I
couldn't get any repair done. I then went to the Walgreens at Gilman
Street and bought some stuff, finishing checkout at noon. I got back
home around 12:16 PM.

#### Afternoon

I left home again around 2 PM. I visited three mobile repair stores,
starting with Joe's iPhone repair on 2081 Center Street, then going to
Mobile Kangaroo at 133 Berkeley Square, and finally, going to the
repair shop at 2387 Telegraph Avenue. None of them supported screen
repair for my moto e5. The Mobile Kangaroo person said that he only
does iPhone repairs now, but he doubted that anybody would support
repairs of a moto e5 because the labor cost of replacing the glass
exceeds the cost of a brand new replacement phone.

I then went to the T-Mobile store on Shattuck Avenue (arriving at 3:26
PM). I asked for the low-cost ph ones; the lowest-cost phone available
was the moto g pure at $156. However, the demo phone wasn't turning
on. I decided to come back later.

I then went to Trader Joe's, arriving at 3:42 PM and finishing
checkout at 3:48 PM. I left at 3:51 PM. I walked to the Berkeley
library where I did some Googling to check the specs of the moto g
pure. I then went back to the T-Mobile store (arriving at 4:06 PM),
bought the moto g pure, and switched my plan to the $10 monthly
plan. I left at 5:01 PM and got back home.

#### Evening

I then made a trip to Office Depot on Gilman Street to buy
stationery. I finished checkout aat 6:52 PM. I then went to
the Apple Store and bought the Macbook Air at 7:26 PM.

I then went back home. Later I made a trip to Bangkok Thai Cuisine to
get food.

## Thursday April 7

In the evening, I went to Krishna Copy. I arrived at 3:47 PM. I had
lease documents printed, signed them, and had them scanned back again.
After that, I made some food purchases, recorded at
[food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Friday April 8

In the afternoon I went to my new place near the Ashby BART to check
out the keys and found an issue with the keys and got it resolved.

## Monday April 11

In the afternoon I went to downtown Berkeley looking for a place with
wi-fi (since there were issues with my home Internet). Asha Tea House
didn't have it and the Starbucks was to-go-only. So I went to the
Berkeley Public Library and hung out there between 3:05 PM and a
little after 4:30 PM. By then I learned that my home Internet was
fine, so I headed back, making some food purchases on the way back,
recorded at [food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Tuesday April 12

In the evening I went to my new place to set things up and check some
things. I left around 6 PM taking BART from North Berkeley to Ashby,
and arrived at the new place around 6:20 PM. I did various setup
steps, then went to the nearby Walgreens (on Adeline Street) to stock
up on toiletries, checking out of Walgreens at 7:57 PM. I was in the
Walgreens from 7:42 to 8 PM. I then went back to the new place, did
some more setup, then headed home a little after 8:30 PM and got back
home around 9 PM.

## Friday April 15

In the afternoon I went to downtown Berkeley. I started by going to
Goodwill to donate some old clothes. I then went to Citibank for some
stuff, finishing at 2:20 PM. I then did some food purchases recordd at
[food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Saturday April 16 and Sunday April 17

move stuff to my new place and set things up there. I also made a trip
to the Walgreens at Adeline Street on the afternoon of Saturday April 16.
