# Activity tracker listing times and places I was outside the house

This continues with the spirit of my [2021 activity
tracker](2021-activity-tracker.md), recording my trips outside the
home. I exclude trips for jogging and running. I also exclude trips
for grocery purchases and picking up takeout from restaurants; you can
get a sense for those trips by looking in
[food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

In the evening, I made a trip to Citibank in downtown Berkeley for
some financial transactions, finishing at 4:48 PM. The food purchases
in the rest of my trip are recorded in
[food_purchases.sql](../sql/food_purchases.sql).

## Wednesday February 2
