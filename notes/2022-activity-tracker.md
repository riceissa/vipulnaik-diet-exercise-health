## Tuesday April 5

In the morning, I fell when running, resulting in a phone screen crack
(see [here](2022-04-05-fall-and-phone-screen-crack.md)).

#### Morning

To remedy this, I left home around 11 AM and went to the repair shop
at 1008 University Avenue. The technician there was on vacation, so I
couldn't get any repair done. I then went to the Walgreens at Gilman
Street and bought some stuff, finishing checkout at noon. I got back
home around 12:16 PM.

#### Afternoon

I left home again around 2 PM. I visited three mobile repair stores,
starting with Joe's iPhone repair on 2081 Center Street, then going to
Mobile Kangaroo at 133 Berkeley Square, and finally, going to the
repair shop at 2387 Telegraph Avenue. None of them supported screen
repair for my moto e5. The Mobile Kangaroo person said that he only
does iPhone repairs now, but he doubted that anybody would support
repairs of a moto e5 because the labor cost of replacing the glass
exceeds the cost of a brand new replacement phone.

I then went to the T-Mobile store on Shattuck Avenue (arriving at 3:26
PM). I asked for the low-cost ph ones; the lowest-cost phone available
was the moto g pure at $156. However, the demo phone wasn't turning
on. I decided to come back later.

checkout at 3:48 PM. I left at 3:51 PM. I walked to the Berkeley
library where I did some Googling to check the specs of the moto g
pure. I then went back to the T-Mobile store (arriving at 4:06 PM),
bought the moto g pure, and switched my plan to the $10 monthly
plan. I left at 5:01 PM and got back home.

#### Evening

I then made a trip to Office Depot on Gilman Street to buy
stationery. I finished checkout aat 6:52 PM. I then went to
the Apple Store and bought the Macbook Air at 7:26 PM.
