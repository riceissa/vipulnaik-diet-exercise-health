# Best practices around intense food consumption

The following foods are ones I consider intense:

* Very intense: spicy outside food, including food from Indian and Thai restaurants
* Moderately intense: Sauerkraut and kimchi
* Not intense on its own but can aggravate other intense stuff: Walnuts

Below are some best practices around the consumption of these foods.

## How to consume

### Dilute and neutralize

Make sure to not have very intense or moderately intense foods on
their own. Dilute with water at a minimum, and ideally mix in with the
rest of my food including almond milk, yogurt, miso ginger broth,
etc. This reduces the intensity of the spice.

### For walnuts, chew well and carefully

As walnuts have sharp edges, chew well and carefully, and be careful
not to miss the mark when biting.

## General frequency limits

### For moderately intense foods, limit to one food type and to one meal per day

My general practice is to have sauerkraut or kimchi with my morning
meal. I generally have kimchi once every 3 or 4 days and sauerkraut on
the remaining days. Sauerkraut has fewer ingredients and I have a
pattern of tolerating it better.

### For very intense foods, do not have more than one meal every 4 days, and try to avoid consumption of moderately intense foods for the day of to two days after

For very intense foods, limit to one meal every 4 days. Also, if aware
in advance, try to avoid sauerkraut / kimchi consumption the day of,
and for two days after, the intense food consumption. Symptoms (anal
swelling, mouth issues, etc.) from very intense foods can take up to
two days to appear.

## Limits related to fasting

See [best practices around fasting](best-practices-around-fasting.md).

## Limits before important events

### Try to not consume very intense foods for up 7-14 days prior to any critical appointments

For instance, a dental cleaning or vaccination appointment. The exact
gap can be determined based on other circumstances. 14 days is safest;
7 days is cutting it close.

### Limit consumption of moderately intense and aggravating foods prior to dental cleaning appointments

Since the mouth is an area where sauerkraut, kimchi, and nuts can
cause injuries or aggravate them, limit the consumption of these foods
prior to dental cleaning appointments. The limit as of now is six
days; see [best practices around dental cleaning
appointments](best-practices-around-dental-cleaning-appointments.md)
for more details.

For other kinds of appointments, it is okay to consume these foods
leading up to the day of the appointment.

## Limits after experiencing issues

### After mouth issues

To be safe, I should pause consumption of sauerkraut, kimchi, walnuts,
for one or two days if I can feel a clear swelling with my tongue and
my thoughts are directed to it, even if there isn't significant
pain. However, if I don't have any external obligations for a while, I
can experiment with continuing these foods to see what happens with
the trajectory of the pain.

For very intense foods (outside food) I should refrain from
consumption of these until at least two days after the issue appears
to be completely resolved.

### After anal swelling issues

For anal swelling issues, it is safer to pause the consumption of
sauerkraut, kimchi, and walnuts for at least two days, and to extend
until I feel a clear improvement to the anal swelling.
