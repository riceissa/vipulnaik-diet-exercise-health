Key urination params and values for me in daytime:

* minimum duration after urination to be able to pass urine again if needed: 0 to 90 minutes

* difference between normal adjacent urinations when not trying to hold urine for too long and not proactively trying to void: 90 to 180 minutes

* how long I can hold urine with moderate effo4t if needed: 180 to 360 minutes

Lower urine production rate at night, hither when colder all else equal
