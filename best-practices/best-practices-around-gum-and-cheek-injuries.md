# Best practices around gum and cheek injuries

## Best practices around prevention

### Prevention under the ordinary counrse of events

Under ordinary circumstances, I need to take care of prevention, but
it's not super-critical. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

* Sauerkraut: Make sure to not have sauerkraut in isolation too much;
  always mix it with other milder stuff, e.g., some almond milk.

* Lemons: Similarly, mix lemons with other things and don't have them
  in isolation or the acidity can be too high.

* Walnuts: The main risk here is biting down too hard or having the
  walnut poke my gum and cheek. Remember to not take too many walnuts
  in one serving, and remember to chew well.

* Hot food: For hot, recently, cooked food, consuming it directly can
  result in burning of the mouth. So, it's always a good idea to mix
  it with some cooler food, like refrigerated almond milk or yogurt,
  or other portions of the food that are refrigerated.

### Prevention during high-stakes times

During high-stakes times, such as before a dental cleaning appointment
or before travel or a critical event, I might want to be particularly
careful to not get cheek or gum injuries. For such cases, it makes
sense to skip the consumption of sauerkraut, lemons, and walnuts. It's
hard to stop the consumption of hot food entirely so for that I should
follow the strategy of mixing with cool food.

See, for instance, [best practices around dental
appointments](best-practices-around-dental-appointments.md).

## Best practices after the fact

### Case of a minor injury: no bleeding, no significant pain when eating or during dental hygiene

Minor injuries are ones where there is no bleeding and no significant
pain when eating and during dental hygiene, including rinsing,
flossing, and brushing.

For minor injuries, a minimal set of additional precautions is fine:

* For sensitive stuff like sauerkraut, lemons, walnuts, and hot food,
  try to use the other side of the mouth so that these don't aggravate
  the injury.

* Use cold presses against the area occasionally.

* Monitor for recovery over the next 1-2 days. If there's no recovery,
  consider the possibility that the injur is more major.

### Case of a mid-level injury: no bleeding, but pain when eating or during dental hygiene

Mid-level injuries are ones where there is pain and smarting when
eating or during dental hygiene. For instance, a gum injury may result
in pain when flossing. A gum or cheek injury may cause smarting during
a saltwater rinse or when brushing teeth.

Here are some best practices:

* Flossing: Floss more gently and slowly around the area, but do
  repeated runs instead. Don't skip flossing.

* Rinsing: Continue rinsing as there is a risk of infection without
  doing it.

* Brushing: Brush more gently but still cover the area.

* Food: Skip all risky foods (sauerkraut, lemons, walnuts, and hot
  food).

### Case of a more serious injury: bleeding

For a more serious injury where there is bleeding, either
spontaneously or when flossing or rinsing, I should skip that round of
flossing/rinsing in that area, but try again in the next
round. Generally, bleeding should self-repair between successive
rounds.

Also, skip all risky foods.
