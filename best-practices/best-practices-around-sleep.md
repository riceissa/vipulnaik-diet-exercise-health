# Best practices around sleep

This document outlines my best practices around sleep.

## Background on my sleep and waking-up pattern

### My default pattern

Outside of winter months, I generally go to sleep some time between 10
PM and 1 AM and wake up some time between 6 AM and 8:30 AM. In the
winter months, my sleep time and waking-up time might be a little
delayed as it's very cold in the mornings. Also, during the hottest
months as well, my sleep time and waking-up time might also be delayed
as the mornings are the coolest times when it's tolerable to be in
bed.

My default sleep duration is about 7.5-8 hours. Generally, going down
to 7 hours on a day doesn't have significant repercussions.

#### Default minimum gap between last meal and sleeping

I default to a minimum gap of 3 hours between the end of my last meal
and sleeping, with the gap being larger in some cases. I also aim for
a gap of at least 2 hours between the last meal and
shower/bath. Aspirationally, I try for at least 4 hours from end of
last meal to sleep, and at least 3 hours from end of last meal to
shower/bath, but I'm not strict about these under ordinary conditions
(more on the reason for the gap later in the doc).

### Sleeping late and getting up naturally

This may happen, for instance, in cases that I am really hooked to
some task or need continuous attention to it, causing me to sleep
late. It also sometimes happens due to induced laundry delays, or
planning issues with my day.

In such cases, even though I get up naturally, I will very likely not
have gotten my full worth of sleep. The reason is that my body is used
to waking up within a specific time range, so if I sleep late, it'll
still wake up around the time range even if the body's sleep needs are
not fully met. A crude heuristic is that if I sleep x hours later than
usual, I will likely wake up about x/3 hours later than usual, so that
I sleep about 2x/3 hours less than usual.

Despite the slight sleep backlog built by sleeping late and getting up
naturally, this is still relatively low-risk as the body has likely
finished the most important functions that it needs to carry out in
its sleep, assuming x isn't too large. For instance, sleeping 2 hours
late, and therefore waking up about 40 minutes late, I have about 1
hour 20 minutes less sleep than usual, but my body was able to give up
the 1 hour 20 minutes of repair work that were least important.

### Interrupted sleep -- waking up suddenly (usually due to an alarm or alert, sometimes due to some pain)

I generally set my alarms and alert settings so that they are likely
to go off only after I wake up naturally. However, there are a few
scenarios where these might go off earlier:

* Alerts for some services at work are on at night, as they relate to
  critical infrastructure that needs to be up continuously. The
  frequency of triggering is very low, but it can still happen.

* In some cases, I may set an alarm for an early time, due to some
  early-morning activity I need to do. My general goal, where I have
  enough advance notice, is to adjust my sleep cycle gradually. But in
  some cases that isn't feasible.

Separate from these, I might get up sometimes to urinate or due to
some pain or bad dream. Usually, I'm able to go right back to sleep,
but sometimes I can't. As of May 2024, this is very rare, but it could
happen.

The case of waking up suddenly tends to be worse in terms of bowel
disruption than the case of sleeping late, likely because the body's
plans are disrupted. Waking up suddenly more than 1 hour prior to my
natural waking-up time can cause symptoms such as grogginess and
fatigue; waking up more than 2 hours prior can cause symptoms such as
constipation and bowel cycle disruption.

### Sleeping with an overnight emotional or physical stress

As a general rule, *unresolved* emotional stress (for something that I
was not able to resolve), or physical stress of some sort, increase my
sleep needs. The general increase range is about 1 hour. However, in
case of infections that my body needs to actively fight, I may need to
increase by 2 or 3 hours.

This therefore changes the goalposts in terms of the approximate
thresholds given in the earlier subsections.

## Best practices to follow during normal times

By normal times I'm referring to times when I'm not facing a health
situation that requires extra sleep, and I am not trying to adjust my
sleep cycle.

### When to get into bed

The latest time by which I should be in bed should be the earliest
among these:

* At least 7 hours before the beginning of the range of time at which
  I naturally wake up; for instance, if I naturally wake up between 7
  AM and 7:30 AM these days, I should aim to be in bed by midnight.

* At least 8 hours before the time I have set my alarm for

* At least 9 hours before the time I absolutely need to get out of bed

The earliest time by which I should be in bed is 2 hours earlier than
the latest time, unless I am feeling fatigue that makes me want to go
to bed earlier than that.

Worked example: Let's say that these days, I tend to get up around 8
AM, I need to be up by 9:30 AM for a work meeting at 10:30 AM, and my
alarm is set for 8:45 AM. The respective latest sleeping time
constraints imposed by these are 1 AM, 1:30 AM, and 12:45 AM. The
earliest of these is 12:45 AM, so the latest time I can get in bed is
12:45 AM.

Also, **don't get into bed less than 3 hours after finishing my last
meal**.

### Urinate right before going to bed

Urine pressure is one reason I sometimes prematurely wake up. So,
urinating right before going to bed, even if I don't feel like I have
enough urine built up, can help reduce that. This is not always
necessary, but is a best practice.

### Sleeping in

* If I have completed at least 7 hours of sleep, feel awake and alert,
  and want to get out of bed, I should get out of bed.

* On the other hand, if I have completed fewer than 7 hours of sleep,
  then I should try to get some extra time in bed (even if not fully
  asleep) until I hit 7 hours. If I have urine pressure build-up I
  should go and urinate first so the remainder of my time in bed can
  be more relaxed.

* If I have significant bowel pressure already (before getting to an
  upright position) then it may be better to have a bowel movement and
  then spend some extra time in bed. However, generally speaking,
  bowel pressure doesn't become significant at less than 7 hours of
  sleep until I spend some time in a seated or upright position, so in
  order to get extra sleep I should try to avoid getting in a seated
  position.

### Reducing the incidence of unplanned late sleep

As far as reducing unplanned late sleep goes, there are two related
goals:

* Sleep by the latest time described in [When to get into
  bed](#when-to-get-into-bed).

* Have the flexibility to sleep earlier if I feel sleepy or if other
  new information comes up; as much as possible I should not feel
  "trapped" to stay awake by choices made earlier in the day, if I
  feel cognitively or physically too fatigued to be awake or do useful
  things while awake.

#### Have clarity every day as to the latest-in-bed time

Right when I wake up in the morning, I should have clarity on the
latest time I can get into bed. This should be at the back of my mind
and can influence my decisions throughout the day. In some cases, new
information such as weather details, planned house maintenance, or
developments in terms of meetings can change the time a little bit.

For instance, in the worked example in [When to get into
bed](#when-to-get-into-bed), I worked out that I need to get into bed
by 12:45 AM. I should have awareness of that piece of
information. Also, I should adjust it based on any sleep backlog or
need for additional seep.

#### Set a 1-hour-notice-to-sleep time

My 1-hour-notice-to-sleep time should be set to at least 1 hour prior
to the latest time I need to get into bed. However, it should
generally be set to earlier, to account for the possibility of feeling
sleepy earlier. As a general rule of thumb, if I don't have a sleep
backlog, making sure that it's at least 9.5 hours prior to my natural
waking-up time is wise. However, if I have a sleep backlog, I should
add in approximately the number of hours of sleep backlog I estimate,
with relevant adjustments.

For instance, in the worked example in [When to get into
bed](#when-to-get-into-bed), I said that my natural waking-up time
these days is 8 AM. Based on this, my 1-hour-notice-to-sleep time
should be set at 10:30 PM.

#### What I should have completed by the 1-hour-notice-to-sleep time

My target should be to finish all activities of these kinds by the 1-hour-notice-to-sleep time:

* Laundry, including sorting of the dried laundry

* Cooking and cleaning dishes post-cooking (I sometimes defer cleaning
  dishes to a little later even after being done cooking)

* Any cognitive work on the computer that I need to get done during
  the day, or that I can't leave in the middle easily

* All end-of-day dental care including final rinsing, flossing, and
  brushing teeth

* At least one iteration of my night checklist, including checking
  email, messages, text messages, calendar events, etc.

* I should have elapsed at least 2 hours since finishing of my last
  meal (so that with an extra 1 hour, I would hit 3 hours).

The only activities I need to do that I may not have done in the
1-hour-notice-to-sleep time are semi-optional end-of-day grooming
activities including shower/bath and shaving. I say semi-optional
because if I get a sudden wave of drowsiness, I could in principle go
to sleep without doing them, and wake up the next day and catch up on
them.

#### What I can do after the 1-hour-notice-to-sleep time

There are two approaches I can use:

* Do shower/bath and shaving (if pending) first, so that I am fully
  ready to sleep. If I then feel energetic and want to do more, do
  more. If I feel semi-energetic, do it in bed from my phone.

* Continue working on the computer, but making sure to pick tasks that
  I can interrupt any time, with no commitment. In particular, this
  means no actions affecting code or configuration changes to
  production sites (whether personal or day job). The kinds of things
  that fit here include things like documentation, writing prose,
  etc. where it's okay to leave it half-way and okay to make
  mistakes. I should also maintain a strong preference for things that
  can be done on dark mode screens (so not visiting websites with a
  white background too much).

I think which of these approaches I use depends on my level of fatigue
and expectation that I might suddenly feel drowsy. If I anticipate
suddenly feeling drowsy, it's better to take the former
approach. However, the latter approach is better otherwise since it
means I have a forced break between screen time and going to bed (the
shower/bath time).

Either way, I need to make sure to still hit my latest-in-bed time.

### Reducing the incidence of sudden waking up

* If possible, make sure the alarm is set to a reasonable time, at
  least 30 minutes after when I expect to wake up naturally.

* To the extent possible, configure alerts so that they don't phone me
  before my natural waking-up time. On occasions where I need to sleep
  in a bit more due to going to sleep late, I may want to tweak the
  alert settings temporarily.

## Best practices to follow during health issues

### When to get into bed

When I'm experiencing health issues where I have reason to believe
that additional sleep might be helpful, I should adjust the guidance
regarding the latest time I should be in bed as follows:

* At least 8.5 hours before the beginning of the range of time at
  which I naturally wake up; for instance, if I naturally wake up
  between 7 AM and 7:30 AM these days, I should aim to be in bed by
  10:30 PM.

* At least 9 hours before the time I have set my alarm for

* At least 10 hours before I absolutely need to wake up

The earliest time by which I should be in bed is 2 hours earlier than
the latest time, unless I am feeling fatigue that makes me want to go
to bed earlier than that.

Also, in case of health issues affecting digestion or with potential
effect on digestion, **increase the minimum gap from finishing my last
meal to sleeping to 4.5 hours from the default of 3 hours**. This
increases the chances of finishing the third MMC wave before I go to
sleep.

If I can't simultaneously satisfy the condition of getting sufficient
sleep and maintaining the increased eating/sleeping gap, it's a
judgment call what to prioritize, and it generally depends on whether
my issue is more one of digestion or one of fatigue or
infection-fighting.

### Urinate right before going to bed

As with nomal times, it is important to urinate right before going to
bed. In fact, it becomes more important to do so, as getting the full
amount of sleep becomes more important when I have health issues.

### Sleeping in

Similar to normal times, I should follow the practice of sleeping in,
but now using 8.5 hours rather than 7 hours as the threshold.

## Best practices to follow during a sleep cycle adjustment phase

For a sleep cycle adjustment phase, I should aim to adjust at a speed
of about 15 minutes per day if feasible, with occasional relaxation to
confirm that Ihave fully adjusted.

During these times, I should follow this guidance:

* Aim to get in bed about 8 hours before the intended waking-up time
  (in case I also happen to have health issues during this time that
  necessitate extra sleep, make this 9.5 hours)

* Set alarms starting 15 minutes after the intended waking-up time.

Create a table with a schedule of adjustments and create another table
with the reality of what transpired.
