# Best practices around medical appointments

This is a master document laying out principles and outlining a
blueprint from which best practices can be developed for individual
kinds of medical appointments.

## Principles governing the best practices

### Interference minimization (local) (local IM principle)

The local IM principle says that there should be minimal interference
between the medical appointment and other things to the extent I can
control them. It's specifically referring to the time of the
appointment, with a suitable buffer of up to a few hours before and
after.

* IM principle as a selection principle for the appointment:

  * Book sufficiently in advance that other things can be adjusted in
    the run-up to the event. At least 1 week and ideally about 3 weeks
    is preferable; beyond 3 weeks there are no significant gains. This
    does conflict a little bit with weather selection, since weather
    forecasting is usually not great for more than 1 week out.

  * Choose a day and time where my personal and work calendar are
    free.

  * Choose a day and time where the chances of day job interference
    are minimal.

  * Choose a day and time so that the risk of weather disruption is
    minimal.

* IM principle as a post-selection adjustment principle:

  * Take care of on-call overrides and maintenance windows.

  * Make sure to mark on calendar and not take on other things that
    might interfere.

  * Make sure to arrange cyclic personal chores so that as little as
    possible is "needed" on the day of the appointment.

  * Check the weather two days before the appointment and reschedule
    if needed and feasible.

### Interference minimization (regional) (regional IM principle)

The regional IM principle says that the time around the medical
appointment should be such that I have adequate time for preparation,
appointment, and recovery. The details here depend on how much
preparation and recovery are needed. In general, factors to consider
are:

* Busyness with day job and personal projects

* Other one-off events including travel and medical appointments (this
  is relevant both for general busyness and specific interference
  between the preparation and recovery phases); a general rule of
  thumb here is that a gap of at least 2-3 weeks is ideal if I can
  afford it.

* Load of cyclic personal chores (higher in the winter due to greater
  appetite leading to more cooking and food purchase effort)

* Chances of rain over the time period; even if that particular day is
  clear of rain, rain in the days before and after reduces my
  scheduling flexibility for needed shopping around the period
  (higher in the winter).

### Preparation

There are a few broad angles to preparation:

* Interference minimization discussed in the preceding sections

* Accuracy of testing: This applies to medical appointments involving
  a test, such as a blood test. Pausing some activities prior to the
  appointment may be necessary for more accurate testing. This may
  include pauses on food, supplements, medications, and exercise.

* Conservation of energy: Some medical procedures can be intensive on
  my body, using up my MEWs for the day and more! It may be wise to
  conserve energy in the days leading up to the appointment so as to
  be well-rested.

* Risk reduction: For instance, minor mouth injuries can make dental
  cleaning more painful. For this reason, I pause intense and hard
  food consumption in the days leading up to a dental cleaning
  appointment, even though the risk of mouth injuries per unit
  consumption is small.

* Direct preparation (particularly for new and complex procedures):
  For things that I do regularly, such as blood tests, vaccine
  appointments, and dental cleaning, no direct preparation is
  needed. In contrast, things that are new and/or complex may require
  direct preparation, including research. As much as possible, the
  research should be done well in advance, but some aspects of special
  preparation may need to be done shortly before. Examples may include
  measuring vitals and taking photos before the procedure to be able
  to monitor the procedure's impact.

  Even for things I do regularly, I may still spend some time
  collecting questions that I want to ask during the appointment.

### Recovery

There are a few broad angles to recovery:

* Conservation of overall energy during bodily recovery: For things
  like vaccines, there is an insult to my system and my body needs to
  direct its resources to addressing that insult. For things like
  blood tests, the depletion of blood may result in some need for
  recovery.

* Coping with temporarily reduced capacity and increased injury risk
  to a particular area that was manipulated: For instance, for
  vaccines, the arm muscle that was injected into is sensitive. For
  dental cleaning, the mouth area might be sensitive after having been
  poked around and kept open for a while. After eye exams, the eyes,
  being dilated, have reduced ability to see. It's important to give
  that area enough time to recover and reduce the risk of injuring it
  further or having other mishaps due to not accounting for its
  reduced capacity.

* Documentation effort and processing of the information: Generally, I
  acquire new information, either as part of the appointment itself,
  or in followup reports I receive after the appointment. This entails
  documentation effort and may include further research. I should
  budget for this effort as part of a broader "recovery" and return to
  normalcy.
