# Best practices around meal quantity

## Risks of large meals

I have some risk factors around large meals. I already have larger
meals relative to my overall food intake because I only have two meals
in a day. Some of the risks of large meals are:

* Greater strain on the GI tract, which can lead to abdominal
  discomfort directly

* Higher levels of fermentation for a given meal composition (just
  because there's more FODMAPs in absolute quantities)

* Larger stools, which increases the risk of having to have multiple
  stools in a day and also increases the risk of anal swelling and
  other discomfort due to pressureq

These are generally the factors that give in first, so whereas there
are other risks in principle (like obesity) the feedback mechanisms
from the above should kick in first. This is partly because the nature
of my food is such that the ratio of fiber and bulk to calories is
high, so limiting factors on the fiber and bulk side hit first.

## Ways to reduce the risk of large meals

### Temperature management

Cold temperatures increase my appetite, so trying to stay warm and
keep myself from being in low temperatures for too long can help.

### Shift toward higher protein and fat

I should consider having more protein and fat, which are more filling,
while trying to keep the consumption of fiber and carbohydrates to
only slightly above normal levels.

For instance, have more nuts. Have more vegan probiotic yogurt. Have
more lentils. Focus a bit more on the potatoes and peas than on the
rice and wheat.

### Meal duration monitoring

My summertime meals are in the range of 20 to 30 minutes when relaxed,
whereas my winter meals have in some cases gone to over an hour. This
is too long and is correlated with eating too much.

Particularly in the winter, I should take care to do meal duration
monitoring as follows:

* At around 30 minutes or so, I should start wrapping up my meal --
  the first serving I do after 30 minutes should be my last serving,
  with the possibility of a minor top-up.

* I should aim to finish my meal within about 40 minutes and should
  not go above 45 minutes.

* If there's something I am hooked to (like a video or TV show) that I
  don't want to leave for post-meal cleanup, it's fine to stay on with
  that for up to about 10 minutes after finishing the meal, but I
  should still clearly finish the meal. I shouldn't overeat just so
  that I can continue to consume the content.
