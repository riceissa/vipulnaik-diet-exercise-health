# Best practices around fasting

This document includes some best practices to follow before, during,
and after a fast. I define a "fast" as being 19 or more hours of not
eating, or 10 or more hours of not having my first meal after waking
up, or 3 or more hours of a combination of travel, standing activity,
or being seated in the sun without food and water since waking up. My
body seems capable of handling shorter durations without eating.

In general, the symptom I am trying to avoid is a sore throat,
specifically, a sore esophagus. Looking at the potential causes
[here](https://www.mynurz.co.id/en/article/blog-post-title-one-99frw-9wslr-7hwbc-zmxkc-7beza-9hz5d-2a6fc-zfg67-d5br7-m9hn6-my99z-7styn-jsbsk#:~:text=Sore%20throat.&text=In%20addition%2C%20during%20fasting%2C%20the,errors%20when%20breaking%20the%20fast.),
my guess is that this happens due to "stomach acid rising into the
esophagus" though it could also reflect one of the other causes.

## Before the fast (if it is planned): avoid outside food and avoid intense foods

If I can anticipate a potential fast happening within the next 48
hours, avoid outside food over that time period. Also, make these adjustments:

* Do not consume sauerkraut and kimchi (intense foods I eat at home).

* Do not include cayenne pepper in any meals that I expect to be
  consuming in the 48 hours before or after the fast.

For hard foods, such as walnuts, no prior restraint is needed.

## During and particularly near the end of the fast: hydrate before eating

As much as possible, even if I can't have food, it's important to
drink water. Also, urinate as needed so that the pending urination
doesn't suppress my thirst.

Before breaking the fast, make sure to drink enough water, ideally
multiple times over the 30 minutes prior to eating. This is
particularly relevant if the fast was also accompanied by reduced
water intake, or if I was out in the sun where dehydration is
likely. Also, make sure to urinate in order to make space for drinking
water.

## Foods to avoid for the meals after a fast

* Spicy outside food: If possible, avoid spicy outside food, such as
  the Udupi Palace sambhar. Try to avoid for about a week after a fast
  or at least four days after last-experienced symptoms.

* Walnuts: The sharp edges of the nuts could irritate an already
  inflamed esophagus. Walnuts should be avoided for about 44 hours
  after a fast or after last-experienced soreness (so about two
  calendar days, but setting the limit to 44 instead of 48 hours to
  account for the meal two days later being started earlier than the
  delayed meal due to the fast).

  NOTE: Don't resume in the same meal as resuming sauerkraut, so as to be
  able to isolate any adverse effects of resuming. Stagger the
  resumption into separate meals.

* Sauerkraut: This is very acidic and should be avoided for about 68
  hours after a fast or after last-experienced soreness. However, be
  careful that sauerkraut can be a neutralizing factor for capsaicin,
  which is alkaline, so if I have cayenne pepper mixed in the meal,
  accompany the reduction in sauerkraut with a corresponding increase
  in other neutralizers, including vegan probiotic yogurt.

  NOTE: Don't resume in the same meal as resuming walnuts, so as to be
  able to isolate any adverse effects of resuming. Stagger the
  resumption into separate meals and, if possible, into separate days.

* Kimchi: This has both acidic components and capsaicin, both of which
  can be irritating. This should be avoinded for about 92 hours after
  a fast and after last-experienced soreness.

* Oil: I don't generally have standalone oil anyway, but this
  avoidance can be interpreted in terms of avoiding oil-rich portions
  of my food (for instance, an oily broth that might be in one of the
  storage containers whereas the others are heavier on the soft
  vegetables). This caution should be maintained for the first two
  meals after breaking the fast.

* Cayenne pepper / red pepper: For any meals prepared after I am aware
  of a sore throat or anticipate consuming after a fast, I shouldn't
  add red pepper to the food. However, it's fine to consume
  already-cooked food that has a bit of red pepper, as long as I take
  adequate amounts of vegan probiotic yogurt to dilute the effect.

## Foods to have more of after a fast

* More liquid foods, such as almond milk, as these help with
  hydration.

* Miso and ginger broth

* Vegan probiotic yogurt
