# Best practices around vaccine appointments

## Use the calendar reminder as the date of booking

The calendar reminders have been selected to allow for a reasonable
cadence and so that the times are reasonable in terms of weather
conditions, cadence of vaccination, and relationship with peak
infection cycles. However, the time of vaccination may need to be
adjusted based on factors such as the following:

* Current or upcoming travel that makes it difficult to get the vaccination

* Travel or other high-risk activity that makes it beneficial to delay
  getting the vaccination to have peak immunity during the high-risk
  activity

## Booking process

### Date selection

* Booking about 1-3 weeks in advance is ideal. However, in some cases,
  there may be significant backlogs and it may only be possible to
  book 3+ weeks in advance.

* Preferable date / time: Friday 3 PM; this minimizes interference
  with my day job

* Check the weather conditions around the time of booking: In
  particular, avoid days of rain forecast (if possible), or days when
  it is unusually hot or cold

* Check for appointments and other commitments on the day of booking
  or the two days after booking

* Try to select a time with nothing of this sort in the preceding or
  following two weeks:

  * Ill health of any sort

  * Medical appointments such as eye care appointments, other tests, or
    dental cleaning appointments

  * Intercity travel

  * Unusually high-stress events

### Booking steps

* Book on the website such as Walgreens. Make sure that the location,
  date, and selected vaccine are correct. Double-check all entered
  information.

* After booking, fill in consent forms and other related
  information. This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done
  on-location.

* Review the email received for details such as what to carry, when to
  arrive.

* Add the vaccine appointment to the calendar, with the appointment
  time starting 2.5 hours prior to the appointment time and ending 2.5
  hours after the appointment time. Invite my work email address as
  well so that the time range shows as blocked on the work calendar as
  well.

## Calendar reminders

Add the following calendar reminders.

### ASAP after the appointment date and time are confirmed

* Maintenance windows for work alerts where I'm primary: I can set
  these up when the appointment time is confirmed. Generally, set the
  maintenance window to start two hours prior to the start and end
  five hours after the end.

* Overrides for me for services where I rotate with others: Try for
  the override to be a full-day override covering at least two hours
  prior to the start and four hours after the end of the appointment.

* Work calendar events and Slack reminders: I should clear out as much
  as possible, and then after that be particularly careful in the 2-3
  days leading up to the appointment to keep that day clear.

### Reminder for date of appointment

The calendar event should start 2 hours prior to the appointment and
end 2 hours after the appointment. The actual appointment time should
be noted in the calendar event. I should aim to arrive at the location
about 10 minutes prior to the reporting time (which is generally 15
minutes prior to the appointment, so in total it's 25 minutes prior to
the appointment).

Make sure to invite my work email address to the calendar event so
that it is blocked on the work calendar.

### Shopping reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Carrying heavy grocery bags can be a challenge after getting a sore
arm due to a vaccine.

### Weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Set a weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment.

### Reminders to pause and resume strength exercises and hand gripper exercises

* Pause reminder for strength exercises and hand gripper exercises:
  Two days prior to the vaccine appointment

* Resume reminder for hand gripper exercise in the non-vaccine arm:
  Four days after the vaccine appointment

* Resume reminder for hand gripper exercise in the vaccine arm: Seven
  days after the vaccine appointment

* Resume reminder for strength exercises: Nine days after the vaccine
  appointment

### Reminders to pause and resume jogging and breath holds

* Pause reminder: morning of the vaccine if it's in the afternoon; one
  day prior if it's in the morning

* Resume reminder (conditional to feeling well): three days after the
  vaccine

### Packing / prep reminder for the night before the appointment

Anything I need to get ready for the vaccine appointment should
ideally be handled the previous night, so that even if I'm in a rush I
don't miss doing it. This includes any planning for additional things
I hope to do in the trip after the appointment.
