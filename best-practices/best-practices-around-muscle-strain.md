# Best practices around muscle strain

Stub document. Points to expand:

* Exercise: Higher peak strength, longer hold duration, more reps

* Regular activity: Carrying stuff with too much strain on a specific
  muscle, heavier load, or longer than usual

Best practices for carrying thin stringed stuff: don't put load on a
very small area -- spread it out. If not possible to spread too much,
switch around over time. Rest each hand periodically.

For laundry, don't put on PIP joints.

For grocery bags over long durations, try to put more on wrist area
than PIP area. Latter is weaker.
