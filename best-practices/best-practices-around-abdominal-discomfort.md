# Best practices around abdominal discomfort

This document describes best practices around abdominal discomfort,
outside of the ones directly caused by bowel disruption (as covered in
[another
doc](best-practices-around-bowel-disruption-due-to-sleep-and-stress.md)
(though it can co-occur with these).

The main culprit seems to be overexertion leading to a dysregulation
of the body causing hyergastrinemia -- excess stomach acid
production. However, there could be other causes.

## Best practices for prevention

### Avoid multiple overexertion factors

The following are some overexertion factors that can have weird
dysregulatory effects, even outside of their direct effect on bowel
movements:

* A lot of exercise (walking, running) in the morning before eating
  any food.

* Extended sun exposure before eating any food.

* Delaying initial food consumption significantly (see also [best
  practices around fasting](best-practices-around-fasting.md)).

* Not having enough water before having food (see also [best practices
  around fasting](best-practices-around-fasting.md)).

As much as possible, try to avoid all of these. For instance:

* If it's hot in the morning, and I need to go shopping in the morning
  (maybe because it gets even hotter in the afternoon and evening)
  skip jogging and go shopping. Don't try to pack jogging + shopping
  into the time before my morning meal.

* Try to eat a little bit of food, or take some walnuts for a snack,
  if leaving early in the morning for something without having the
  time to eat a proper meal (though ideally I should adjust my sleep
  cycle, get up early, and have a proper meal before leaving).

* If I did get delayed quite a bit due to jogging etc., try to not add
  further delays by cooking stuff before eating -- try to eat using
  the stuff already cooked.

* Conversely, if I don't have a lot cooked, try to avoid/skip outside
  trips.

## Best practices after the fact

I should try these best practices for about 2-3 weeks to see if the
issue resolves itself, before escalating to more complex things to
try.

### Extra sleep

Follow the guidance in [best practices aroud sleep section "Best
practices during health
issues"](best-practices-around-sleep.md#best-practices-during-health-issues)
for every night where I experienced abdominal discomfort during the
day, and for two extra nights. In particular, the guidance here sets a
time to go to bed about 1.5 hours earlier than otherwise. The same
guidance also recommends staying in bed a little extra until the 8.5
hours are completed.

### Extra care with bowel movement

Even if my bowel movement cycle does not appear to be disrupted, I
should still take extra care to make sure I have a full bowel
movement. This means waiting a little longer in the morning for bowel
pressure build-up before going for a bowel movement, and spending a
little more time on the bowel movement to increase the chances of a
full bowel movement. Even if bowel movement cycle isn't the source of
the problem, it can compound or exacerbate other issues.

#### Mid-day bowel movements

Consider trying a mid-day bowel movement if I feel persistent
discomfort, even if I don't specifically feel an urge for a bowel
movement. Don't force or push though -- if nothing comes out after 5
minutes, give up and continue the day as normal. Mid-day bowel
movements can help even if bowel movement cycle isn't the primary
cause, insofar as the fuller bowel might be contributing to the
discomfort that's primarily from another reason.

### Vegan probiotic yogurt consumption

With every meal, try to consume something like 1/8 to 1/6 of the 16 oz
Kite Hill Greek Style Plant-Based Yogurt, or equivalent for whatever I
am consuming. (Remember to check for mold carefully before consuming
each time, given the mold issues known to happen for vegan probiotic
yogurts). A rule of thumb is that each serving should have about 1
teaspoon of the yogurt. At the end, if I'm burping, the burp should
have that yogurt. Overall, this will make it so that even if I have
some symptoms of excess stomach acid, my discomfort from these
symptoms will be lower.

Do this as long as I experience discomfort, and for at least one day
after that.

Tapering off:

* Two days after I last experienced discomfort, I can reduce the
  yogurt amount to 2/3 of the old amount (so around 1/12 to 1/9 per
  meal), while still having it every meal.

* After two days at the halved level, and if discomfort does not
  return (so four days after last experienced discomfort), I can
  switch to yogurt for only the evening meal, still at 1/12 to 1/9 per
  meal.

* After two days at the single-meal level, I can choose to stop yogurt
  consumption, though I may want to continue at that level till that
  pack is finished.

In steady state, my aim should be to have yogurt for about a one-week
period at least once a month and not more than once every two
weeks. This keeps me exposed to the nutrients and probiotic elements
of yogurt while making me not depend on or crave this very yummy but
expensive item. However, in the recovery period from discomfort, my
consumption might go up to one per 3-4 days for a period of a week or
two while I recover.

### Exercise

If the abdominal pain is continuous and makes me feel like I don't
want to exercise, skip exercise. This should be okay for at least 3-4
days; beyond that it may make sense to try some exercise.

However, if the abdominal pain is intermittent and I still feel like
exercising, then still exercise. Exercise can help with motility and
also help suppress excess stomach activity by directing resources away
from it, and in general it leaves me feeling better.

However, try to not "max out" on aerobic and strength exercises as
that could lead to lactate buildup that can interact in a bad way with
existing abdominal pain. In general, it's a good rule of thumb to stop
at around 90% of the level I would normally stop at, particularly for
something like jogging.

Also, potentially skip exercise if I am getting natural exercise on
the day, even if under normal circumstances I would have done both.

## Best practices for acute or persistent cases

Acute cases are cases where the pain level is getting to the point
where it is getting in the way of my daily life.

Persistent cases are ones that show no improvement after 2 weeks of
following the previous section's best practices or show no significant
improvement after 3 weeks of following the previous section's best
practices.

In these cases, additional steps may be needed.

### Pain medication experimentation

For acute cases, or for persistent cases where I want better
management, consider taking acetaminophen (one pill alternating days)
to see the extent of symptom relief it provides. Do *not* take
ibuprofen as it can worsen symptoms for some potential causes.

### Supplement experimentation

* Take Vitamin B Complex supplements daily for 2-3 days and observe
  the effect on symptoms.

* Look into other supplements.

* Potentially look into stopping or skipping existing supplements.

### Temporary eliminations

Try temporary eliminations of these foods. Temporary eliminations
should be for at least 2 days (preferably at least 3 days) but should
not be continued more than a week without a diet review:

* Potatoes, peas, broccoli, kale: The easy way is to skip potatoes
  prep (that includes these foods) and either exclude kale from the
  mixed veggies prep or avoid consuming the kale part of that prep.

* Sauerkraut: This can be done separately from the potatoes, peas,
  broccoli, kale, or with partial overlap.

* Vegan probiotic yogurt: Only do this after resuming sauerkraut, and
  if the other eliminations fail.

### Blood tests

Consider getting these tests done if the problem persists, and if I
haven't gotten the tests done for six months or I have other more
serious symptoms:

* Complete blood count

* Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)

### Advanced tests

Consider getting these advanced tests:

* Urine organic acid

* SIBO breath test

* Phospholipid test

* Microbiome test
