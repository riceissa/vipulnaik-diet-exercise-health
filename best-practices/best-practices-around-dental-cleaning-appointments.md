# Best practices around dental cleaning appointments

## Note the appointment date and time

I generally book my dental cleaning appointment as part of the
previous dental cleaning appointment, and the usual interval is 27
weeks. My booking preference is Wednesday 1 PM.

Note the appointment date and time in the notes for the previous
appointment, and also put a calendar reminder. The calendar reminder
should start two hours prior to the appointment start time and then
continue to three hours after the appointment end time. Invite my work
email account so that the time is blocked on my work calendar as well.

## Calendar reminders around the event

### Shopping reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Set up a reminder for a grocery shopping trip for the evening two days
before the dental cleaning appointment. It's good to have groceries
shopped for ahead of the appointment if possible.

### Reminder to pause consumption of sauerkraut, walnuts, and spicy foods

* Reminder for three days prior to the appointment to pause
  consumption of sauerkraut, walnuts, and spicy foods. This reduces
  the risk of injury in the cheek and gum area that might cause more
  pain during the dental cleaning process. Any food prep during this
  time should not include cayenne pepper. I should also avoid outside
  food.

  Consume a vegan probiotic yogurt instead of sauerkraut over that
  time period.

* Reminder for the day after the appointment to resume consumption of
  walnuts.

* Reminder for three days after the appointment to resume consumption
  of sauerkraut, with a note to delay if I'm experiencing excess
  salivation.

### Reminder to skip exercise on the day of the appointment

This is to conserve time and energy for the appointment.

### Reminder to set reminders for the next dental cleaning appointment

Set a reminder for the evening of the dental cleaning appointment to
set calendar reminders for the next dental cleaning appointment
following this doc.

## Things to keep in mind during the appointment

Don't keep the mouth open too wide for too long. In particular, close
it for brief intervals in between when the hygienist is not working on
the mouth. Keeping the mouth open for too long can trigger excess
salivation the next day.
