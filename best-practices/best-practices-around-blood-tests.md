# Best practices around blood tests

## Build out the blood test plans a few months in advance

This includes research on the blood tests, their costs, methodologies,
and what I'll learn from them.

Also get the latest information on the test locations and hours.

## Book the tests

Book the tests. Generally, the tests don't have a fixed appointment
time, just a walk-in time. I should aim to book at least two days
before my intended date of going for the tests. Keep in mind the test
location hours (usually Monday to Friday, opening around 7 AM or 8 AM,
and staying open till around 4 PM).

Try to book at a time when there is nothing of this sort in the
previous or next two weeks:

* Ill health of any sort

* Medical appointments such as eye care appointments, other tests, or
  dental cleaning appointments

* Intercity travel

* Unusually high-stress events

## Calendar reminders

### Reminder for the test date

Since the test is likely to include at least some pieces that require
fasting, I should do the test in the morning, ideally after waking up,
bowel movement, morning tasks, and bath (and without eating).

Set a calendar reminder from 7 AM to noon on the test date. Invite my
work email address as well so that the time is blocked on my work
calendar.

I should budget to leave about 2 hours after waking up, arrive 30
minutes after leaving, and spend about an hour at the test location,
then 30 minutes back.

Since there's not fixed date, just an intended date, I can move this
around if things happen at work.

### Reminders to sleep early starting two days before the test date

I don't need to sleep super-early, but it's good to not stay up too
late. Set calendar reminders for these.

### Reminder to eat so that I finish about 14 hours prior to my expected blood draw time

This will depend on the specific appointment time, if any; if no
appointment, use the estimated time of walk-in.

### Shopping reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Carrying heavy grocery bags can be a challenge after getting a sore
arm due to a vaccine.

### Weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment

Set a weather check reminder for two days prior to the appointment.

### Reminders to skip exercise starting the day prior to the blood test

It is recommended to not do vigorous exercise for at least 24 hours
prior to a blood test, so skipping exercise the day prior to the blood
test should be fine.

### Reminders to resume hand gripper exercises and strength exercise

NOTE: Jogging and breath holds can be resumed the next day after the
blood test if I'm feeling up to it. No calendar reminder is needed.

* Resume reminder for hand gripper exercises for the arm from which
  the blood wasn't drawn: Three days after the blood draw

* Resume reminder for hand gripper exercises for the arm from which
  blood was drawn: Five days after the blood draw

* Resume reminder for strength exercises: Seven days after the blood draw

### Reminders to pause supplements for two days prior to the blood test

**NOTE: If measuring B12, it is important to pause consumption of the
B complex supplement for at least five days, and ideally at least a
week, before the blood test (this is because the consumption of biotin
and folate, both of them present in the B complex supplement, can
interfere with B12 measurement). Even otherwise, it may make sense to
pause B complex supplements given that I appear to have had an adverse
reaction to them once.**

Recent consumption of supplements can distort blood test results,
particularly when the blood test is for the materials being
supplemented (the risk is highest for water-soluble vitamins). Pausing
supplement consumption starting two days prior to the blood draw gets
rid of the distortion.

Supplement consumption can be resumed in the meal I have immediately
after the blood test, or the next day.

### Review diet in the context of the blood tests to see if any temporary dietary restrictions are needed

For most blood tests, no dietary restrictions are needed (other than
12-hour fasting). However, please review the blood test list and check
whether any dietary restrictions make sense.

## Day of the appointment

### Make sure to drink enough water (if testing allows)

Drinking enough water can help with the blood draw process, reduce my
hunger, and reduce the risk of dehydration from the journey for the
blood draw.

NOTE: If I am also doing a breath test, the breath test may require
not taking water for a certain amount of time prior to the test. So,
if the breath test is included, make sure to follow the instructions
after taking into account the expected amount of time to get to the
test location. If I end up getting to the test location sooner, figure
out the expected wait time and perhaps delay check-in for the breath
test if needed.
