## Things to do in advance of the breath testing

* Keep track of the time of finishing the last meal, as this will be
  part of the information I log.

* It is advisable to not do this between food consumption and the
  post-consumption saltwater rinse and floss. In other words, make
  sure to finish the saltwater rinse. This reduces the risk of oral
  bacteria affecting the results.

* It is advisable to not drink water and not use lip balm for at least
  15 minutes prior to the reading.

## Starting about 10 minutes prior to the test time

* Get my phone out.

* Get the device out. The phone and device should be close by for the
  duration of the recording.

* Open the FoodMarble app on my phone, click the + button at the
  bottom, and select Breath.

* Double-tap on the device and watch the phone connect to it.

* When prompted, double-tap again.

## For the actual breath test

* Swallow saliva right before the test to reduce the risk of drool on
  the mouthpiece.

* After a normal breath out, hold your breath for at least three
  seconds by pinching the nose, while pressing the button on the
  device.

* While keeping the nose pinched, put the mouth on the mouthpiece and
  breathe out slowly until the phone says that the breath is completed
  and shows the fermentation scores.

## After the breath test

* Save the breath test results in the SQL file.

* Remove the mouthpiece and wipe **only the outer side** with hand
  sanitizer (don't wipe the inner side as that will touch the device
  directly when I put it back on; also do not pump hand sanitizer
  directly onto the mouthpiece but spread it with a finger). Leave it
  to dry for at least 20 minutes before reattaching.

* Charge up the device while waiting for the mouthpiece to dry.

## Putting it back

* Before affixing the mouthpiece back, make sure that it is completely
  dry. Complete drying takes somewhere between 15 minutes and 45
  minutes.

* Put the mouthpiece back on the device and put it in the case.

* Put it back in the box.

* If I took the USB charging cable out, put that back in too.
