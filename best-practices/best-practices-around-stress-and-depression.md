1. Overexertion/overstimulation (operates at level of hours to days) (see [best practices around exertion and stimulation](best-practices-around-exertion-and-stimulation.md)
2. Task category fatigue -- by bucket, type of mental muscle used, etc. (operates at level of days to years)
3. Entitlement violation -- sense of not living up to goals, having promises violated, etc. See https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/psMczuJ9KbujgrgLq/entitlement-as-a-major-amplifier-of-unhappiness
4. Hectic pace -- happens staying slightly below exertion/stimulation limit for extended period of time without doing enough of the high-joy things
5. Backlog sense -- lots of things "to do" and the pace of execution seems too slow
