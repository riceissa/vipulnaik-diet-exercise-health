# Best practices around skin wounds

Little cuts on the skin can happen from time to time. This document
describes a bunch of best practices.

## Prevention

### Moisturizing

Moisturizing at a decent regularity in general, and particularly after
being in dry environments, cold or hot environments, or extensive hand
washing or sanitizer use, can keep the overall risk of wounds low.

The hands in particular should be moisturized frequently given their
extensive contact with other stuff and frequent washing and
sanitization.

Also, taking particular care to moisturize areas that have minor skin
damage, that makes them more sensitive to bigger wounds, can help.
