# Best practices around skin wounds

Little cuts on the skin can happen from time to time. This document
describes a bunch of best practices.

## Prevention

### Move slowly to points of contact

Injury happens generally on impact, so as long as I have a low speed
when touching things, the injury will be that much smaller. So, it's
important to move slowly.

### Moisturizing

Moisturizing at a decent regularity in general, and particularly after
being in dry environments, cold or hot environments, or extensive hand
washing or sanitizer use, can keep the overall risk of wounds low.

The hands in particular should be moisturized frequently given their
extensive contact with other stuff and frequent washing and
sanitization.

Also, taking particular care to moisturize areas that have minor skin
damage, that makes them more sensitive to bigger wounds, can help.

## Handling

### Things to avoid / reduce if possible

* Hand washing and sanitizer use: If possible, delay activities that
  require these, particularly in the first 1-2 hours after the injury,
  until hemostasis is completed. If they do need to be done, try to do
  them without the injured area.

* Hand gripper exercise: Try not to do hand gripper exercises with the
  injured hand.

* Strength exercises: Try not to do strength exercises with the
  injured hand.

* Carrying heavy loads: Try to use the other hands.

* Handling of sharp or rough objects: Some things in the realm of
  cleaning, packing, physical reorganization, may match this.

* Typing when the wound is at the fingertips: Basically if the bandage
  is constantly hitting the keyboard, switching to activities that
  don't involve typing, or involve less typing, is preferred. Also
  consider using the other hand more for typing.

* Eating: Particularly in case of left hand injury, try to delay
  eating till the wound is healed enough.

### Bandaging

Bandaging plays a few roles:

* It helps achieve hemostasis faster (i.e., stopping bleeding) by
  applying pressure.

* It reduces the mess created by bleeding for the the nearby skin and
  for things I touch.

* It creates a safer environment for recovery, with less exposure to
  air and bacteria.

* It provides a slight cushion against additional impacts that could
  exacerbate the injury.

Bandaging works great for injuries on the shoulder, arms, and
legs. But it has issues with the areas most likely to get injured:
hands and face. Specifically for hands:

* Bandaging (other than waterproof bandaging!) doesn't interact well
  with handwashing or any activities that involve running water
  through the hands (such as washing dishes). While we should try to
  avoid those activities anyway, in some cases they need to be done.

* Bandaging can get in the way of eating.

* Bandaging, when on the tips of the fingers, can get in the way of
  typing.

For face:

* Bandages can be hard to keep stable given the curvature of the face.

* Face movements when eating or doing dental care can also affect the
  stability of the bandages.

In all cases not involving the hands or face, try to keep the bandage
for as long as possible, until I feel fully healed.

However, in cases involving the hands or face, follow this guideline:

* Use waterproof bandages, *except* when *all* these conditions are
  satisfied:

  * The cut is small and I expect it to heal within 30 minutes to the
    point where no bandage is needed. This is typical of pin prick
    cuts made when drawing blood. Here, a bandage is mainly just a way
    to stop the bleeding a little faster and reduce the mess created
    by blood on the fingers.

  * I am at home or a home-like environment, and don't have immediate
    need (over the next 1 hour at least) to apply water near the area,
    for instance, to wash hands, wash dishes, etc.

  Basically, when in doubt, and when on the move, use waterproof
  bandages if available. The waterproof bandages are a little more
  expensive but much better in terms of allowing me to do my normal
  activities.

* Keep the bandage until hemostasis has occurred. As a general rule,
  wait at least two hours before checking, unless checking is needed
  earlier because of some needed activity.

* For severe cuts where hemostasis has occurred but the wound tends to
  get irritated by hand washing, try to use a waterproof bandage. But
  if no waterproof bandage is available, and you *do* need to hand
  wash, remove the bandage first, do the activity, dry the hands, and
  then apply the bandage again. In cases where there is no shortage of
  bandages, apply a new bandage each time, However, in case of
  shortage of bandages (for instnace, when outdoors with a relatively
  limited supply of bandages), it's okay to reapply the bandage if it
  doesn't have a lot of visible blood on it.

* Put a bandage on overnight or over extended periods where I know
  that it won't conflict with anything.
