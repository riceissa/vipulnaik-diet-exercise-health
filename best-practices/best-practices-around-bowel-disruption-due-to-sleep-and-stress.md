# Best practices around bowel disruption due to sleep and stress

This document describes my observations related to bowel disruption
due to sleep and stress, and some of the best practices to both
minimize the disruption and recover quickly from it once it happens.

## The role of insufficient sleep and the compounding effect of stressors

In general, insufficient sleep leads me to have a bowel movement that
is incomplete and/or needs more effort (i.e., less spontaneous bowel
pressure). This can be considered mild constipation relative to my
usual cycle. In most cases this is not a big issue. I'm able to
proceed with my day normally and return to a regular bowel movement
cycle the next day. However, some factors can exacerbate the
situation.

### My default sleep and waking-up pattern

Outside of winter months, I generally go to sleep some time between 10
PM and 1 AM and wake up some time between 6 AM and 8:30 AM. In the
winter months, my sleep time and waking-up time might be a little
delayed as it's very cold in the mornings. Also, during the hottest
months as well, my sleep time and waking-up time might also be delayed
as the mornings are the coolest times when it's tolerable to be in
bed.

My default sleep duration is about 7.5-8 hours. Generally, going down
to 7 hours on a day doesn't have significant repercussions.

### Sleeping late and getting up naturally (without much additional stress)

This may happen, for instance, in cases that I am really hooked to
some task or need continuous attention to it, causing me to sleep
late. It also sometimes happens due to induced laundry delays, or
planning issues with my day.

In the absence of additional stress, and assuming I can still wake up
naturally (rather than via an alarm clock or alert), this is not too
bad. Other than mild constipation (slightly smaller bowel movement
with less spontaneous bowel pressure) everything should be fine. Only
the minimal set of precautions outlined in the next section should be
taken.

A good heuristic is that I should be getting at least five hours of
sleep in such cases; the "getting up naturally" constraint will
usually force this.

### Waking up suddenly (usually due to an alarm or alert, sometimes due to some pain)

I generally set my alarms and alert settings so that they are likely
to go off only after I wake up naturally. However, there are a few
scenarios where these might go off earlier:

* Alerts for some services at work are on at night, as they relate to
  critical infrastructure that needs to be up continuously. The
  frequency of triggering is very low, but it can still happen.

* In some cases, I may set an alarm for an early time, due to some
  early-morning activity I need to do. My general goal, where I have
  enough advance notice, is to adjust my sleep cycle gradually. But in
  some cases that isn't feasible.

Separate from these, I might get up sometimes to urinate or due to
some pain or bad dream. Usually, I'm able to go right back to sleep,
but sometimes I can't. As of May 2024, this is very rare, but it could
happen.

The case of waking up suddenly tends to be worse in terms of bowel
disruption than the case of sleeping late, likely because the body's
plans are disrupted. As a general rule, if I wake up more than 2 hours
prior to what my natural waking-up time would be, there's a good
chance I'll not be able to have a bowel movement, though it can vary
based on what I ate the previous day.

### Sleeping with an overnight emotional or physical stress

As a general rule, *unresolved* emotional stress (for something that I
was not able to resolve), or physical stress of some sort, increase my
sleep needs. The general increase range is about 1 hour. However, in
case of infections that my body needs to actively fight, I may need to
increase by 2 or 3 hours.

This therefore changes the goalposts in terms of the approximate
thresholds given in the earlier subsections.

While the stressor may increase my sleep need, it doesn't necessarily
increase the amount of sleep I *get* because it may also agitate me
into waking up. Nudging myself to stay in bed a little longer is often
helpful.

### Sleeping during a sleep cycle adjustment phase

Things can be a little weird with my bowel movement during a sleep
cycle adjustment phase, such as after travel across timezones, or
deliberate sleep cycle adjustment in order to adjust to a routine of
getting up earlier in the day for some event. For deliberate
adjustment, keeping the adjustment speed to about 15 minutes per day,
with the occasional relaxation to confirm that I have fully adjusted,
is good.

## Best practices around prevention

### Target sleeping time to always try to adhere to

I should always aim to be in bed by the earlier of these times (even
when there is no bowel disruption so far):

* At least 7 hours before the beginning of the range of time at which
  I naturally wake up; for instance, if I naturally wake up between 7
  AM and 7:30 AM these days, I should aim to be in bed by midnight.

* At least 8 hours before the time I have set my alarm for

* At least 9 hours before the time I absolutely need to get out of bed

### Reducing the incidence of unplanned late sleep

Unplanned late sleep can occur for a few reasons:

* Laundry delays: In some cases, the laundry room is in use when I
  want to start my load of laundry, or switch it from the washer to
  the dryer. Where feasible, I should prefer to delay laundry by a day
  rather than have my laundry work stretch through the night;
  attempting laundry when I still have enough stuff that a day's delay
  won't matter helps with that decision. Also, where possible, I
  should try to start laundry at least six hours before my latest
  reasonable sleep time.

* Food prep needed: Sometimes, I am out of food and need to prepare
  new food, and the process just ends up taking a lot of
  time. Moreover, I need to stay up for a few hours after finishing
  the food. Better planning to make sure I start food prep early
  enough can help with this.

* Getting sucked into something: This could be something related to my
  day job, personal project, etc. Often, this happens in cases where
  the day was spent in chores or meetings, and it's only late in the
  evening that I finally get a chance to dig into something.

In general, unplanned late sleep isn't too bad, and particularly the
last cause can be a net plus in many cases! However, especially for
the first two, it's often preventable and I should try to follow the
strategies to reduce the incidence of these.

### Reducing the incidence of sudden waking up

* Make sure the alarm is set to a reasonable time, at least 30 minutes
  after when I expect to wake up naturally.

* To the extent possible, configure alerts so that they don't phone me
  before my natural waking-up time. On occasions where I need to sleep
  in a bit more due to going to sleep late, I may want to tweak the
  alert settings temporarily.

## Best practices after the fact

### Target sleep time to try to adhere to in light of bowel disruption (and for at least 2 nights after seeming recovery)

I should aim to be in bed by the earlier of these times, if I have an
ongoing bowel disruption and for at least 2 nights after recovery:

* At least 8.5 hours before the beginning of the range of time at
  which I naturally wake up; for instance, if I naturally wake up
  between 7 AM and 7:30 AM these days, I should aim to be in bed by
  10:30 PM.

* At least 9 hours before the time I have set my alarm for

* At least 10 hours before I absolutely need to wake up

### Drinking water (to be done at all levels of severity)

Unless I have a violent reflex against drinking water, it's important
to make sure to drink water to soothe my gastrointestinal tract that
may be a little confused and stressed. Paradoxically, sometimes
there's a general lethargy that may get in the way of my drinking even
my usual amount of water.

### Skipping or postponing exercise (only in case of clear fatigue, lethargy, or other symptoms)

In general, exercise can be good at revigorating my body, so in cases
where I feel up to it, I should still go for exercise. However, I
should skip exercise if bowel disruption due to less sleep is
accompanied by fatigue or lethargy. At minimum, it may make sense to
postpone exercise to the evening from the morning and assess in the
evening if I feel up to it.

### Having foods that are lighter on my system (in case of at least mild constipation and some unusual GI stuff)

I recommend having about 1/4 to 1/3 of the 16 oz Kite Hill Greek Style
Plant-Based Yogurt over the day, roughly evenly split between the
meals of the day.
