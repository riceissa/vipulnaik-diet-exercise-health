# Dental self-exam checklist

- [ ] Examine teeth in mirror
  - [ ] For front teeth, look in the normal mirror, using the hands to pull parts of the mouth to get a better view
  - [ ] For back teeth, use the special mirror while standing in front of the normal mirror
- [ ] Take photos of front and back teeth using the intraoral camera and save to GitHub in the following order (there should be a total of 12 photos)
  - All back teeth before all front teeth
  - Within each, all upper (maxillary) teeth before all lower (mandibular) teeth
  - Within each, left, then middle, then right
  - The location to save in GitHub should be in the `diet-exercise-health-private` repo in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - Also save in my Google Drive in `self-photos/dental/<YYYY-MM-DD>`
- [ ] Compare these photos with the previous photos
