# Hearing checklist

- [ ] Run through and record results for online hearing test at https://www.resound.com/en-us/online-hearing-test (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) in SQL; compare with the previous results to see if there is any concerning loss of hearing, and if so, schedule a followup test for a week later
- Run through and record results for test where I try to play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo (using normal headphones for air conduction an bone conduction headphones for bone conduction) all in one ear and find the lowest possible volume for each ear where I can make out the words -- if it's higher than 1/64, schedule followup test in about a week
  - [ ] Left ear with normal headphones
  - [ ] Right ear with normal headphones
  - [ ] Left ear with bone conduction headphones
  - [ ] Right ear with bone conduction headphones
- Check for balance when I play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVVaqFDG6Fo
  - [ ] Normal headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [ ] Bone conduction headphones, when set to balanced, feel centered rather than skewed to one side
  - [ ] For normal headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness
  - [ ] For bone conduction headphones, switching back and forth between all left to all right does not change perceived loudness
