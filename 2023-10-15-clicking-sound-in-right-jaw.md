# 2023-10-15: clicking sound in right jaw

On 2023-10-15, I noticed a clicking sound in my right jaw occasionally
when opening and closing my mouth. There was no equivalent sound in my
left jaw, and even after several attempts, I couldn't generate a sound
on the left jaw. The sound on the right jaw came and went. I did not
experience any pain so the sound was the only concerning aspect.

I found the YouTube video [How to INSTANTLY Fix a Clicking and Popping
Jaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5h0c7pZJzE) that had a bunch of
useful exercises. I didn't try all of them; I just tried the one of
applying pressure behind the ear and that one seems to have worked. I
might return to the other exercises in this video if I encounter any
similar issues in the future.
